1
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,997
Son of a...

2
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,257
I'm not leaving.

3
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,847
Walt, I'm not leaving.

4
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,391
Oh, my God.

5
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,696
I can hear your cell phone ringing.

6
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,243
This is ridiculous. I can't...

7
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,960
What is going on with you?
I've left you, like, 23 messages.

8
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,255
- And?
- And?

9
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,341
We need to talk about the car wash.

10
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,094
Skyler,
now is not a good time for me, okay?

11
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,013
- Can we talk about this later?
- No, okay? We can't.

12
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,560
Why are you doing...?

13
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,020
Oh, Jesus.

14
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,190
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just bumped it. That's all.

15
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,026
Okay, I'm... I'm coming in.

16
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,326
Okay.

17
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,371
Exactly what happened?

18
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,000
It's complicated
and I don't wish to discuss it.

19
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,211
- It's none of your concern.
- Are you in danger?

20
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,839
Walt.

21
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,595
Walt, I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me right now.

22
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,139
- Are you in danger?
- You know what?

23
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:50,104
Let's just say that I have a hell
of a lot more on my mind right now...

24
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,232
...than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,525
Okay?

26
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,694
So if you could just...

27
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,779
Please.

28
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,742
Okay.

29
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,996
Okay. Then we go to the police.

30
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,875
- What?
- We tell them everything.

31
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:14,295
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety...

32
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,673
...and the safety of your family
and you need help.

33
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,217
- What choice is there?
- What choice?

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,720
If you're in danger then it would be...

35
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,181
Wait, wait, stop, stop. Stop.

36
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,975
You keep saying that word.
"Danger." "Danger."

37
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,811
- But you said...
- No, I have never used that word.

38
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,940
I said "complicated"
and then you flew off the handle.

39
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,193
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that.

40
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,154
Okay? Where'd that come from?

41
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,115
A fall in the shower?

42
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,161
This is just so passive-aggressive,
you know.

43
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,454
Passive-aggressive?

44
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,249
I go two days without returning
your phone calls, two days...

45
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,754
...and I have one minor little incident,
and now you're telling me...

46
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,590
...that I should turn myself
in to the police!

47
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,008
- A minor incident?
- Yes.

48
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,095
What minor little incident?

49
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,267
I had an argument with a coworker,
okay?

50
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,020
And?

51
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,939
I had an argument.

52
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,024
We were in this bar...

53
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,361
...and we were discussing
a particular business strategy.

54
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:26,575
And it got heated and out of control,
and he hit me. Once.

55
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,912
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,289
And that's it.

57
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,294
You were in a bar fight?

58
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:45,136
Yes, Skyler. I was in a bar fight.

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,764
So you're okay?

60
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,309
Really?

61
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,481
Yes.

62
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm okay.

63
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,405
And I think, in the end,
that it may have been a good thing...

64
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,742
...because we were able to clear the air
and, you know...

65
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,952
Mutual respect, and...

66
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,455
So...

67
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,499
Frozen peas.

68
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,421
- What?
- It's the best thing for the swelling.

69
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,133
Oh, it's not really swollen, it's just...

70
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,177
No peas.

71
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,345
You don't even have ice.

72
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,683
I will get peas, I will get ice.
Peas and ice, I'm writing it down.

73
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,853
L...

74
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,400
I need you to promise me...

75
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,154
...that if things do get dangerous...

76
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,907
- Skyler...
- Promise me.

77
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,326
Absolutely.

78
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,246
So...

79
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,625
Car wash.

80
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,767
Honey. Charles.

81
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,563
Take a look at this kitchen.

82
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,903
Hi there.
Can I answer any questions?

83
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,572
Yes. Any chance of a top-off?

84
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,493
Oh, I think we can
help you out there.

85
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,585
So, what do you think?

86
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,880
Oh, very nice. Very open.

87
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,341
Oh, I agree. it flows.

88
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,760
Whole lot of natural light.

89
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,220
Michael Kilbourne.

90
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,014
- Tori Costner.
- It's nice to meet you.

91
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,018
Well, three bedrooms, one and a half
baths on just under half an acre.

92
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,980
There's a non-attached casita
out in back.

93
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,692
Permit usable as office
or guest suite.

94
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,318
Plank wood floors.

95
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,945
Central heat and air.

96
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,239
I see you're married.

97
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,074
No, divorced.

98
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,576
Very recent.

99
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,703
- Old habits.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,331
- But any children?
- Yes, as a matter of fact. A little boy.

101
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, how old?

102
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,378
He turned 4 in May. He's a Gemini.
Would love this yard.

103
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,589
Oh, plenty of space for a jungle gym.

104
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,550
And the neighborhood preschool
is fantastic.

105
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,094
I think Eli is going to be
homeschooled.

106
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,471
- Well, great.
- Not for religious reasons.

107
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,057
I wanna make sure
he's getting attention.

108
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,144
He'll still go to summer camp
and whatnot, playdates.

109
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,606
- Don't want him to be socially awkward.
- Makes sense.

110
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,775
He tests very highly, 96 percentile.

111
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,071
But that whole right brain, left brain.
You want those in balance.

112
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,364
Oh, yeah.

113
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,244
You said the casita has plumbing?

114
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,415
I work a lot with clay,
so I need access to running water.

115
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,585
Well, it's pipe-fitted
for a quarter bath so...

116
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,171
Make a perfect studio.

117
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,468
This could work.

118
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,764
Hell, that's the doctor's plan
to get her patients at ease.

119
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,099
If you know what I mean.

120
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,601
But, nurse...

121
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,728
Hello? I'm back.

122
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,438
That's okay.

123
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,149
- Hank?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,452
I had to go to three places
to get the moisturizer that you like.

125
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,912
But I got that.

126
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,166
And I got your Shiner Bock
and your chips.

127
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,503
And I couldn't resist.

128
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,716
The complete encyclopedia
to fantasy football.

129
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,763
- Look, it has all the latest rankings.
- Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos.

130
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,057
Wait, I...

131
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,560
I said Cheetos, like, 10 times.
You need me to write it down?

132
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,605
No, and I don't need you to be mean
about it either.

133
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,776
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I said Cheetos... sound.

134
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:15,155
Virtually impossible to confuse
Cheetos with Fritos, seems to me.

135
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,451
- Where are you going?
- I... Back to the store, I guess.

136
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,121
Here.

137
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,291
And the draft's not for two months,
so this is useless.

138
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,098
Can you believe it?

139
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,685
What?

140
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,271
What? This.

141
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,737
Well, you always said this place
could be bugged.

142
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,947
- Now we know.
- Yeah, well.

143
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,199
I don't like it.

144
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,910
It's a violation of the work space.

145
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,621
Yeah, I guess.

146
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,167
You wanna do something?

147
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,003
Do something?

148
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,880
Like what?

149
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,383
Go-karts?

150
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,387
Go-karts. What...?

151
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:25,768
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

152
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,978
It's pretty fun.

153
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,277
No, actually I have...

154
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,697
...some kind of a meeting, so...

155
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,115
All right, whatever.

156
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,913
Rain check?

157
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,540
Yeah. Sure.

158
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,131
How you doing?

159
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,302
- Good.
- Yeah?

160
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,597
You okay?

161
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,686
Is there anything
we should talk about?

162
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,318
How's your eye?

163
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,156
Yeah, it's fine.

164
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,536
Anything we should talk about?

165
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,753
For what it's worth...

166
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,923
...getting the shit kicked out of you...

167
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,511
...not to say you get used to it...

168
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,515
...but you do kind of get used to it.

169
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,905
Two words: nail salon.

170
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,241
Perfect for money laundering.

171
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,494
It's a high-volume business
with a discreet work force.

172
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,372
I mean, nobody does,
"Mister, me know nothing"...

173
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,041
...better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn
and her gals.

174
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,710
Mr. Goodman...

175
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,961
"Saul," please.

176
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,338
Now, for the lady of the house.

177
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,799
Drum roll.
How about a lifetime supply...

178
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,260
...of French manicures
and enzyme peels?

179
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,596
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Pinch yourself.

180
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,016
We're not buying a nail salon,
Mr. Goodman.

181
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,351
- We're getting the car wash.
- I'm sorry.

182
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
Am I missing something here?
Didn't you already try that?

183
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,485
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you
took a run at this Bogdan character...

184
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,738
...and he wrestled you into submission
with his eyebrows.

185
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,866
Ten million,
that was the asking price, right?

186
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,952
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

187
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,123
Nice negotiating. Yeah, I mean,
hey, you bombed. it happens.

188
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,627
You were smart to call me. Now...

189
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:01,256
You just sit back, relax
and let a professional take over.

190
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,468
That's for me. Excuse me.

191
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,641
What do you want? I'm in a meeting.

192
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,810
Why didn't you think of that before?
It's not my...

193
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,104
I'm in a meeting.

194
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,400
Can Huell use your bathroom?

195
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,237
Huell?

196
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,865
Sure. The top of the stairs.

197
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,992
He'll be quick.

198
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,622
It's a stomach thing. it's...

199
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,749
So where were we?

200
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,752
- Professionalism.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,421
So if the guy won't sell, he won't sell.

202
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,591
I don't accept that.
I don't accept that he won't sell.

203
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,928
I think he just lacks the proper...

204
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,304
...motivation.

205
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,431
Motivation.

206
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:58,564
As in, "motivation" motivation? I mean,
just so we're on the same page here...

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,733
...are you saying we make him an offer
he can't refuse?

208
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,361
Nothing so dramatic as that, no.

209
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,405
Motivation.

210
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,701
Attitude adjustment.

211
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,540
This one, she's a keeper.

212
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,959
Well,
an audit can be highly motivating.

213
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,003
I know a gal at Tax and Revenue.

214
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,590
You give her 10 minutes,
she'll have his sky raining frogs.

215
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,552
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

216
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,972
We don't want them looking at us
after Bogdan sells.

217
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,891
All right, how about an lCE raid?

218
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,728
He's got illegals working over there.
He has to.

219
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,648
We are not getting a bunch
of poor innocent people in trouble, no.

220
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,444
Yeah, and also you're gonna need them
after you take over.

221
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,031
Hey, how about terrorism?

222
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,242
"Oh, Agent Hoover, I gotta tell you...

223
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,622
...I've seen some real 'lslamic' comings
and goings over there at the car wash.

224
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,667
Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans
pulling up in vans and stuff like that."

225
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,379
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

226
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,842
Okay, well,
we're just spitballing here, so...

227
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,928
Okay, there's always:

228
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,432
"You got a real nice place here.

229
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,227
Be a shame if something
happened to it." That angle.

230
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,397
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,983
Violence?

232
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,028
Attitude adjustment.

233
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,321
Oh, no. That, no.

234
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,783
That is not at all what I meant.
I... we do not do that.

235
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,494
That's not who we are, right?

236
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,414
Yeah, no, no, no. She's right.

237
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,709
Look, do I need to state the obvious?

238
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,047
I mean, there's gotta be dozens
of car washes in this area.

239
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,800
Who says it has to be this one?

240
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,885
I do.

241
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,970
I say it has to.

242
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,722
Why?

243
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,975
I just do.

244
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,937
God.

245
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,147
Well, that clears things up.

246
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,734
I don't like him. Bogdan.

247
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:12,406
He was condescending to me,
rude about you, and I do not like him.

248
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,408
Simple as that.

249
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,122
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman more than I do.

250
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,124
But in this business...

251
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,459
And walt can back me up on this.

252
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,879
...the number one rule
is don't take things personally.

253
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,550
What do you mean, rude about me?

254
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,726
Something along the lines
of you weren't man enough...

255
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,936
...to face him yourself.

256
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,732
- What?
- That you had to send your woman...

257
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,526
...to do your business for you.

258
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:54,823
Speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna
go on record and say this is a bad idea.

259
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,993
- Now, I advise against...
- it's this one. it's this one.

260
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,335
Okay, so...

261
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,759
All we have to do is think
of a non-violent, unsuspicious way...

262
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,387
...to purchase the car wash,
that protects the innocents...

263
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,057
...and doesn't cost $20 million.

264
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't everybody speak at once.

265
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,861
I like it.

266
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,488
Yeah.

267
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,580
Hi.

268
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,624
Can I answer any questions?

269
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,711
- Spoons.
- Yes, the owner is quite the collector.

270
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,798
Aren't they something?
One for each of the 50 states.

271
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,009
Puerto Rico is technically a territory.

272
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,474
You know, maybe they were thinking,
"Someday."

273
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,311
So no basement?

274
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,105
- No basement. Sorry.
- That's a problem.

275
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,859
My brother's in the Peace Corps
and won't be back for 18 months...

276
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,362
...and I said I'd hang on
to his furniture.

277
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,241
Well, if you're looking
for storage space, there's an attic area.

278
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,537
Well, an attic might be even better,
as long as it's dry.

279
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,288
- Let's take a tour.
- Okay.

280
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,500
Actually, I have a handout for you.

281
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,465
It has all the information.

282
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,718
- I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.
- Charlotte Blattner.

283
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
- So nice to meet you, Charlotte.
- You too.

284
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,223
So I told him point-blank.

285
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,853
You're my husband and I love you,
but you're 53 years old.

286
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,942
This job has just gotten too stressful
and difficult, and it's time to quit.

287
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,362
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

288
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,615
What a fascinating career
that must have been for him.

289
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,033
It was.

290
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,829
I mean,
NASA was like a second family to us...

291
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,875
...but, you know,
it was time for a new adventure.

292
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:15,130
So between his pension and the income
I bring in from hand modeling...

293
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,676
...we're, you know, comfortable.
When were these floors redone?

294
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,095
Two years ago.
The counters are brand-new.

295
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,306
I can tell. Travertine.

296
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,099
Nice.

297
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,227
- Any children?
- No.

298
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,272
I don't really want kids.

299
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,108
- Is that horrible for me to say?
- Not at all.

300
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,819
Not everyone has to have children.

301
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,780
You should talk to my husband.

302
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,991
Garbage disposal?

303
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,525
Check it out. Score, yo.

304
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,782
- Come on. Come on. What you got?
- You're going down!

305
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,181
I really love your home.

306
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,349
Oh, well, thank you, Mimi.

307
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,020
It has a very European feel.

308
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,731
- You think?
- Oh, I lived in London for years...

309
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,692
...so, yeah, this feels familiar.

310
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,197
Where in London?
I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.

311
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,574
Downtown,
but we were almost never there.

312
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,703
My husband is an illustrator. We
traveled a lot. Paris, ltaly, Denmark.

313
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,165
It was before the kids were in school,
so it was easy to pick up and go.

314
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,377
That was before my youngest, Lucy,
was diagnosed with endocarditis.

315
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,838
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, is that...?

316
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,467
It's a bacterial infection
of the heart valves. it's...

317
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,260
Yeah, it can be...

318
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,096
That's terrible.

319
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,597
Is she all right?

320
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,892
Your daughter?

321
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,477
Is she okay?

322
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,647
Yes. Thank you.

323
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:04,567
The doctors put in a prosthetic valve
so she's... Lucy's fine.

324
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,362
Running and walking, riding horses.

325
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,405
- Thank goodness.
- Yeah.

326
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,867
We're very lucky.

327
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,252
- Excuse me, miss.
- Very nice, thank you.

328
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,921
- I just called the police.
- Okay, then.

329
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,090
I know you stole that spoon.

330
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,051
What are you talking about?

331
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,095
You're a thief.

332
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,931
- Excuse me?
- And a liar.

333
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,433
Making stories up.
What's wrong with you?

334
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,394
No, what's the matter with you?

335
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,063
You better just back off, okay?

336
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,609
- My husband is a DEA agent.
- Oh, I thought he was an astronaut.

337
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,362
Or an illustrator.
Get your crazy lies straight.

338
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,698
You know what, fatty?
You are so lucky...

339
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,451
- ...that I am late for an appointment.
- You're not going anywhere.

340
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,663
- Let go of my purse!
- Not until the police get here.

341
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,206
Let it go!

342
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,876
Let it go! Let it go!

343
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:14,220
You are in big trouble.

344
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,982
Yeah.

345
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,866
Just slow... Hey, just...
Slow down. Start from the... You're...

346
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,577
You're where?

347
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,373
Why the f...?

348
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,334
Why are you...?

349
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:55,261
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?

350
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,227
Jesus, just...

351
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,025
Would you stop crying?

352
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,077
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.

353
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,998
Where they got you?

354
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,842
So good news.
The officer spoke to the homeowners.

355
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,761
They're not gonna press charges.

356
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,930
Good. I won't either.

357
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:43,184
Okay, then. So we're good to go.

358
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,354
You ready?

359
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,114
Marie, you wanna go home?

360
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,873
Marie?

361
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,269
Yes, it's Skyler white
calling for Saul Goodman, please.

362
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,605
Yes, it is important.

363
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,440
Thank you.

364
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,289
Sorry. Same as before.

365
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,874
But this is not right.

366
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,919
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

367
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,463
I've checked your wastewater
inside and out.

368
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:39,842
I've checked your runoff gutters,
and now out here, more contaminants.

369
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,262
Ammonia, acetone, benzene,
nitrobenzene.

370
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,556
No, no, no, this is a mistake.

371
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,310
Where is Gary? He'll tell you
my soap is very good, very green.

372
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,522
Your soap is not the issue,
it's your filtration system.

373
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,024
The very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

374
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,693
But if you're leeching
into the groundwater...

375
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,987
...which is a real possibility here...

376
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,657
...you're gonna need
to replace your system.

377
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:03,908
Replace?

378
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,328
Do you know what cost that is?
Two hundred thousand dollars.

379
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,871
It's a hardship.

380
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,250
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

381
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,295
If you get going, your downtime
shouldn't be any more than five weeks.

382
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,173
Okay. So sorry, you are right.

383
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:24,137
From now on,
we will be extra careful and clean.

384
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,849
- No more pollution, okay? Yes?
- No, I'm sorry.

385
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,685
The state requires you to suspend
all activity...

386
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,563
...until these levels
reach the mandated minimums.

387
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:38,234
- Where is usual man? Where is Gary?
- Got transferred to Las Cruces.

388
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,321
- If you'd like to file an appeal...
- I have done nothing wrong.

389
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,365
Tell me why you shut me down.

390
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,452
- What laws did I break?
- What laws? Several.

391
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,413
Tell me exact specific laws or I refuse.
Right now.

392
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,208
- Tell me what laws I broke.
- The specific laws...

393
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,127
Hold on, okay, hold on, hold on.

394
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,254
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

395
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,966
Okay. The New Mexico
Hazardous Waste Act of 1978...

396
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:06,095
...section 74, chapter four,
part 13 states:

397
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,724
"Whenever the disposal
of solid or hazardous waste presents..."

398
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,143
...an imminent
or substantial endangerment...

399
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,020
...the offender may be fined...

400
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,690
...not more than $5000 each day
in which the violation occurs.

401
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,066
All right, okay.

402
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,069
Now the...

403
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,780
Okay, baby.

404
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:31,954
All right. The EPA can cite him
under the Toxic Substances...

405
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,998
...Control Act of 1976.

406
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,376
U.S. code, title 15, chapter 53...

407
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,628
"... subchapter 1..."

408
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,130
...section 2606.

409
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,342
Satisfied?

410
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,178
Was that specific...

411
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,055
...specific enough for you?

412
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,817
Threw one in the channel
in the 10th.

413
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,403
- I guess they're even now.
- Yep.

414
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,865
And they're even in this match.
Both have...

415
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,909
All done with lunch?

416
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,580
You hardly touched this.

417
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,207
I'm not hungry.

418
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,126
Well...

419
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,547
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

420
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,507
I'm not hungry, Marie.

421
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,509
So don't eat it.

422
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:32,640
Speaking of babies, he has a new one,
Joseph, and a son, Anthony.

423
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,076
Hey, Marie. How you doing?

424
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,830
- I'm okay. ls there a problem?
- No, no.

425
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,707
Everything's fine.

426
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,417
I'm here for Hank, actually.

427
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:04,338
Oh, you're so sweet.
Hank'll be thrilled.

428
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,015
Hard and straight.

429
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,350
- And makes it the wrong way.
- Sweetie.

430
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,603
You have a visitor.

431
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,355
Oh, Jesus.

432
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,816
What now? She rob a bank?

433
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,568
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

434
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,487
Oh, well...

435
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,741
Can't complain.
You know, every day a little better.

436
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,660
- That's good. You're looking good.
- Yeah, well...

437
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,871
...handsome was never the hard part.

438
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,416
Come on in, grab a seat.

439
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,169
Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.

440
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,923
Listen...

441
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:53,554
...thanks again for the other day.
You know, this whole thing, it's...

442
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,598
it's been hard on her.

443
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,643
Forget it. Glad to help.

444
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,855
So rock collecting?

445
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,150
They're minerals, but, yeah.

446
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:10,821
It's cataloging.
You know, sort them, label them.

447
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,199
- It's actually a lot of work.
- Yeah.

448
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,035
No, it looks like it.

449
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,206
- So, what's up?
- Well...

450
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,085
Actually,
I could use your help on something.

451
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,629
Homicide. Possibly drug-related.

452
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,131
You want my help on a case?

453
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,008
What am I, lronside?

454
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,886
No, you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent.

455
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,723
And a pal I just did a favor for,
so let me pick your brain a sec.

456
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,644
You ever come across a guy
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

457
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,437
No.

458
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,524
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

459
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,111
- Okay.
- No signs of forced entry...

460
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,779
...no signs of robbery.

461
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:56,367
Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Where's the drug angle?

462
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,745
We found a notebook at his place.

463
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,748
I made a copy for you,
in case you're interested.

464
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,962
Looks like it pertains to some kind
of methamphetamine superlab.

465
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,213
Yeah.

466
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,884
It's filled with scientific formulas
and chemical purchase lists...

467
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,138
...drawings,
pages and pages of this stuff.

468
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:22,268
It looks big-time, but I'm no authority,
so I wonder if you might take a look?

469
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,522
Come on, Tim, seriously?

470
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,942
What is this,
some sort of a charity thing?

471
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,153
Your expertise could be useful here.

472
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,322
I'm lying here like third base...

473
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,075
...living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

474
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm not even useful to myself.

475
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,998
Want my advice?

476
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,500
You take this to Steve Gomez.

477
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,795
- He'll help you out.
- I give this to Steve Gomez...

478
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,924
...and all of a sudden it becomes a
DEA case, what good does that do me?

479
00:34:55,135 --> 00:35:00,097
If you could just take a look,
tell me what I got here.

480
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,433
I'd really appreciate it.

481
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,021
Yeah.

482
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,733
Whatever.

483
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,780
Thanks, man.

484
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,782
Take it easy.

485
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,326
That's what I do.

486
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,974
- No, no.
- The three, seven, nine. He says, "No."

487
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,411
Well, it was a good try.

488
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,795
Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.

489
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,381
Okay.

490
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,262
So...

491
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:26,308
Nail salon sounded promising.
What do you think?

492
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,185
I think we wait.

493
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,854
Wait?

494
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,691
Skyler, it has been five hours.

495
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,401
He'll call.

496
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,862
- Just wait.
- Just wait.

497
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,405
Look...

498
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,618
it was a good idea.
It was a great idea, but it didn't work.

499
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,414
So why don't we simply chalk it up
as a learning...

500
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,299
White residence.

501
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,926
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

502
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,762
Am I still interested?

503
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,599
Well, I think that depends.

504
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,729
Yes, 879 was the original offer,
but that seems high to me now.

505
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,189
- Now I'm offering 800.
- No, no, no.

506
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,816
- No, don't do that.
- Why?

507
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,445
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person, Mr. wolynetz.

508
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,323
You were rude,
disrespectful towards my husband.

509
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,618
Furthermore, I've met
with quite a number of sellers...

510
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:30,331
...and the market seems much softer
than I thought, so 800.

511
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,381
Well, I understand that you're
disappointed, but that is my final offer.

512
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,761
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
Goodbye.

513
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,181
What are you doing?

514
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,266
I'm negotiating.

515
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,018
Why?

516
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,686
Because I want to pay less.

517
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,396
Oh, no.

518
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,024
Seventy-nine thousand dollars less?

519
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,360
Who cares?
Do you know how much I make?

520
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,613
Yeah, but that's the very reason
we need to negotiate.

521
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,325
We don't wanna arouse suspicion
by not trying to get a good deal.

522
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:11,038
Look, I get the logic, I do,
but you just went too far with it.

523
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,581
You're calling him names?

524
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,251
I didn't call him names.
I said he was unpleasant.

525
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,341
Well, he's not calling you back.

526
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:26,679
I mean,
you didn't honestly think that worked?

527
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,474
Yeah, I do.

528
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,519
No way. Sorry. No.

529
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,022
So look, it's time to move on.

530
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,984
Okay? I'm gonna call Saul.

531
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,403
Where's my phone?

532
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,549
- No.
- What?

533
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,134
- No, just...
- What for?

534
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,970
Wait. wait.

535
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,307
Oh, my God.

536
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,645
Hello.

537
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,606
Hello, Mr. wolynetz.

538
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,735
No one's paying attention
to where these things are.

539
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:27,448
There's gotta be thousands of them
all over the world coming right for us.

540
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:31,618
And put one inside an ice cream truck,
drive it into San Francisco.

541
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,830
I'm not even that scared
of burning up and cannibalism.

542
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,208
To me, the thing that worries me
is getting trampled...

543
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,836
...or shoved up
against a chain-link fence.

544
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,381
If you think about it,
if you're against a chain-link fence...

545
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:49,011
...and you've got a lot, I mean,
a lot of people trying to escape...

546
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,638
...pushing hard enough forward...

547
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,476
...you are gonna get squeezed
right through the chain links.

548
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,188
Like Play-Doh
or some kind of soft meat.

549
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,231
And this is inevitable, okay?

550
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,735
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

551
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,739
And if the fence posts are stuck deep,
really deep with the cement...

552
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,657
...way down inside the ground...

553
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,868
...it's definitely happening to you.

554
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,914
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, bitch.

555
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,334
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

556
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,797
Like soft meat, man.

557
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:29,551
Right through.
Squeezed through there like soft meat.

558
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,137
Like soft meat.

559
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,766
Right through the chain links,
right through the chain links.

560
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,814
Hey. Hey.

561
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,609
Money!

562
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,079
That one was mine.

563
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,957
- Take it easy!
- Hey, you took mine, man!

564
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,750
Yeah!

565
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,817
- Nice.
- Yeah.

566
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,078
To clean cars and clean money.

567
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,914
Hear, hear.

568
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,213
You see?

569
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,215
I told you we'd get it.

570
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,050
Did you?

571
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,890
Seriously.

572
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,809
It was really great work.

573
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,769
It's impressive.

574
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,397
Thank you.

575
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,276
And Saul finally came through.

576
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,946
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

577
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:18,035
Well, yes, he found the guy, but
I told him what to do and what to say.

578
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,038
You're right. That's the hard part.

579
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,501
But, yes, Saul was finally useful.

580
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,670
Throw him a bone.

581
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,009
Oh, my God.

582
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,221
- This is truly amazing.
- Yes, well, it better be.

583
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,598
Three hundred twenty dollars
a bottle.

584
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,974
What?

585
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,228
"Cuvée Pol Roger
Sir Winston Churchill."

586
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,813
Apparently,
it was his favorite champagne...

587
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,233
...so they just named it after him.

588
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,736
- How did you pay for it?
- What do you mean?

589
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,614
No. Cash, I paid cash.

590
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,409
No, I'm asking how did you,
Walter White...

591
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,954
...an unemployed schoolteacher,
pay for it?

592
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,081
- How do you explain it?
- Skyler.

593
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,875
No one saw me.

594
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,585
Whoever sold it to you did.

595
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:12,631
And that's not the point.
The point is we're broke, remember?

596
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:16,760
I'm waiting for your unemployment
check so I can pay the phone bill.

597
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,805
I asked for an extension
from the power company. Why?

598
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:24,434
- Because on paper, we have no money.
- You are completely overreacting.

599
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,730
I'm not apologizing for wanting
to celebrate in some small way.

600
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,149
I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.

601
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,151
I'm asking you to be smart.

602
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,113
I bought one bottle of champagne.

603
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,449
One single bottle, Skyler.

604
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,827
I paid cash. That's it.

605
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,871
That's all it takes, okay?
I mean, look at Watergate.

606
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,957
One piece of duct tape on a door...

607
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,960
...brought down
the president of the United States.

608
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,920
- What? I'm Nixon now?
- No.

609
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,923
What I'm saying is
the devil is in the details.

610
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,510
One little mistake,
one slipup in our story...

611
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,846
...that could ruin us.

612
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,602
Fine.

613
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,033
Gotta destroy the evidence.

614
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,665
And when I look at this image
that is part of the record...

615
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,753
...I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction that could be...

616
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,255
...whether it's from
any sort of signage...

617
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,925
...but especially signage that's
changing every five seconds.

618
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,677
Thank you.

619
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,597
Any other questions?

620
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,601
We have a motion and a second
on the floor to grant the appeal.

621
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,438
All those in favor, raise your hand
and say yes. Yes.

622
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,441
There's four in the affirmative.
Those opposed?

623
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,029
There's five no's and the...
That motion fails.

624
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,407
I would like to make a motion
to uphold the decision...

625
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,994
...and the findings of the EBC.

626
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:10,040
And the motion, then, is seconded
by Councilor Cook. Any questions?

627
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:15,629
I see none. All those in favor, signify
by saying "yes" to deny the appeal.

628
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,011
All those in favor,
signify by saying "yes."

629
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,431
There's five in the affirmative
All those opposed, say "no."

630
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,351
There's four in the negative.
Now, that passes.
