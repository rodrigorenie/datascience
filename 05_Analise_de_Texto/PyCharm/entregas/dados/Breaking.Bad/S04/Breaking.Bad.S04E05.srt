1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,756
Say you understand.

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,591
You understand?

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,552
Tell me you understand, Saul!

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,556
Every dollar.
If you don't hear from me in 24 hours...

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:20,228
No, look. Shut... Saul. Saul, shut up.
Shut up and listen to me.

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,441
I want you to give her every dollar.
I don't care if you stuff it in trash bags.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,404
Just make sure she gets everything.
All right? Just make it happen.

8
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,802
Hi. You've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

9
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,806
Hey. it's me.

10
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,767
L...

11
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:05,481
I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and...

12
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,193
I love you.

13
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,916
Hello, would you like...

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,710
...to try our breakfast chicken chalupa
combo meal?

15
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,212
Gus Fring.

16
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,505
Excuse me?

17
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,717
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now.
Please.

18
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,637
- Mr. Fring isn't here right now. ls...?
- He's here.

19
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,223
His car is parked out front.
He's here.

20
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,933
He was here. Mr. Fring was...

21
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,104
You just go in the back and you tell him
it's Walter White. Understand?

22
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,650
He'll know what it's about.

23
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,405
I'll wait.

24
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,913
Yeah, let me get a chalupa special.

25
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,208
Hello?

26
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,670
Walter, what exactly are you doing?

27
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,214
Where is Jesse?

28
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,550
Jesse's with me. He's fine.

29
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,802
What, do you expect me
to just believe that?

30
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,138
I'm crossing my heart, Walter.

31
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,683
- Where is he?
- Hold on.

32
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,894
- Yo.
- Jesse?

33
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,438
Yeah. What's up?

34
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,608
- Jesse, where are you?
- With Mike.

35
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,194
I know you're with Mike.

36
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,947
Are you all right?
Does he have a gun on you?

37
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
No.

38
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,870
What's going on, then?

39
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,706
- We're driving.
- Driving.

40
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,125
Driving where?

41
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,836
I don't know.

42
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,379
North.

43
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,886
Why is he driving you?
Where is he going?

44
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,846
Beats me.

45
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,016
I don't... Put Mike back on.

46
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,021
Hello again.

47
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,441
Mike,
tell me now exactly what is going on.

48
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,692
Jesse's with me today.

49
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,321
So, what you need to do is go back
to your lab and get on with the cook.

50
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,115
You're gonna have
to muddle through this without him.

51
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,035
- That's what's going on.
- But it doesn't...

52
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,205
- Goodbye, Walter.
- Mike...

53
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,481
Sir.

54
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,526
Excuse me. Hey.
You're not allowed back there.

55
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,860
Excuse me, sir.

56
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,491
As I said, sir, Mr. Fring is not here.
This area is for employees only.

57
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,452
I have to ask
that you leave immediately.

58
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,313
What you told Mr. White, that's...

59
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,609
it's just bullshit, right?

60
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,464
What, you figure on just leaving me
in some ditch?

61
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,969
What do you care?

62
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,805
I don't.

63
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,728
But I'll tell you now,
you better shoot straight, old man...

64
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,565
...or I'll slice off your other ear
before this is over.

65
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,729
You coming?

66
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,777
We gotta do this six more times today
with a lot of miles in between.

67
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,988
I'd like to finish before dark.

68
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,197
This freaking guy, I tell you what.

69
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:06,785
It's like Scarf ace had sex
with Mr. Rogers or something.

70
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,579
Who does this, you know?

71
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,165
Your boy Heisenberg,
thought we had him already.

72
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,208
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

73
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,794
Yeah, no.
Getz busted him a few months back.

74
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,423
Yeah, well, no offense
to Detective Doogie Howser there...

75
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:25,804
...but all he caught was a dipshit lifer
by the name of Jimmy In-'N-Out.

76
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,390
This one, he's your Heisenberg?

77
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,601
Yeah, I believe he is.

78
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,146
So, what are you thinking? Rival
drug gang taking out the mastermind?

79
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,024
Any names I should check out?

80
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,859
I wish I could help you there.

81
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,321
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

82
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,199
One is a beanie-wearing
jizz-stain...

83
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,785
...by the name of Brandon Mayhew,
street name "Badger."

84
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,538
Definitely not a player.

85
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,665
And the other one...

86
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,877
...is Jesse Pinkman.

87
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,214
He and I have a history.

88
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,007
Yeah.

89
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,343
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

90
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,137
That would surprise me.

91
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,517
Well, we have a composite
of a person of interest.

92
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,604
It's a guy the neighbors saw
at Boetticher's place...

93
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,856
...right after the shooting.

94
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,278
- Yeah. Sorry.
- No, hang on to it, just in case.

95
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,031
We got a couple of prints
we're hoping to lD.

96
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,284
If I get any kind of hit,
I'll keep you in the loop on that.

97
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,786
You know...

98
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:35,415
...Tim, look,
I appreciate what you're doing, really...

99
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,544
...you know,
keeping me involved and all...

100
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:43,882
...but, you know, finding this guy
Heisenberg dead like this...

101
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,594
...I have to say, it...

102
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,973
...kind of feels like closure to me.

103
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,060
Hank, you really are a big help here.

104
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,812
No, I know. I get it, really.

105
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,815
But I'm done.

106
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,131
You don't need to do that.

107
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,509
This is why I'm out here, right?

108
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,012
To be, like, your backup?

109
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,643
So if I'm out here
in a guard-type capacity...

110
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:22,689
...to watch over the money,
that means I need, like, a gun, right?

111
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,483
Nope.

112
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,502
I mean, isn't that, like, idiotic
for me to be out here without a gun?

113
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,129
You haven't said dick
about what I'm doing here.

114
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,256
Now I'm supposed to do it
without a gun?

115
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,926
How does that even make sense?

116
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,764
What? I can smoke, right?

117
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,934
Not a chance.

118
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,897
It's finally hitting me
what the plan is here.

119
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,192
It's to bore me to death...

120
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,696
...so mission accomplished
because it's totally working.

121
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,073
Great job.

122
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,704
You know,
I really do get what's going on...

123
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,833
...with all the dead drops
and bags of cash.

124
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,631
Me and my boys had the exact same
system when I was running things.

125
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,257
My crew.

126
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,721
Nowhere near the same cheese
you guys are slinging, but same theory.

127
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,683
You know, maintain separation
between dealer and supplier...

128
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,936
...reduce risk...

129
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,438
...et cetera.

130
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:14,736
Look, don't you think it'd be good if
there was some communication here?

131
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,031
You got me riding shotgun
to every dark anal recess in the state.

132
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,575
Be nice if you clued me in a little.

133
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,164
I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?

134
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,334
And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy...

135
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:33,088
...then you should just tell me
what the hell is up.

136
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,554
- What?
- You are not the guy.

137
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,474
You're not capable of being the guy.
I had a guy, but now I don't.

138
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,769
You are not the guy.

139
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,273
- Then what the hell am I doing here?
- I don't know.

140
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,067
It's not my call. I just do what I'm told.

141
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,571
And now you're gonna do
what you're told, which is to sit here...

142
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,909
...shut up, and stay in the car
till we finish our pickups. You got it?

143
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,068
- We having second thoughts?
- Every hour of every day.

144
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,989
Let me tell you,
that is perfectly normal.

145
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,157
But your expectations are realistic.

146
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:10,286
You have a good, solid business plan.
I'm feeling very confident.

147
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,914
You have an excellent shot
at making this work.

148
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,794
Walt?

149
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,923
Are you good?

150
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,010
Yeah.

151
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,224
All right.

152
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,029
Well, my congratulations
to the both of you.

153
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,156
Thank you very much, Alan.

154
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,658
It is my pleasure.

155
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,164
Mr. white.

156
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,875
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

157
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,588
I'm bringing the car over first thing
next week for a wash and wax.

158
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,090
- We'll be looking for you.
- I'll be there.

159
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,925
- Thank you again.
- You're welcome.

160
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,053
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

161
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,102
It's official.

162
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,189
How are you feeling?

163
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,778
I'm...

164
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,946
Well, I'm... How do you feel?

165
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,034
Nervous.

166
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,037
Scared.

167
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,956
This is a big step, Walt.

168
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,250
If we don't do this right...

169
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,835
We'll be fine.

170
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,837
We will?

171
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,968
Tell me again.

172
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:57,393
We will be fine. Believe it.

173
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:03,441
If we're gonna do this,
I mean, really gonna do this...

174
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,486
...then we have
to promise each other...

175
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,655
...no more secrets.

176
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,035
There can't be any mistakes
like before.

177
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,038
There has to be complete honesty.

178
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,624
I'm all for that.

179
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,627
Good.

180
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,296
Well, then...

181
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,966
...how about a drink to celebrate?

182
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,094
- Well...
- Well, we own a big-ass car wash now.

183
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,139
We do.
I guess that merits a celebration.

184
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,640
Nothing too expensive.

185
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,435
- Right. Right. Non-fancy liquor it is.
- Yes.

186
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,730
Just as long as it gets the job done.

187
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,321
It's me.

188
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:56,244
I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and...

189
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,789
I love you.

190
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,605
- Okay.
- Okay.

191
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,192
- Just take it off. Just take it off.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

192
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,890
The sheets,
they smell different than I remember.

193
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,184
Don't they?

194
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,105
New fabric softener.

195
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,733
Yeah, I like it.

196
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:15,114
I also got a new haircut.

197
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,868
- Don't know if you...
- Oh, yes, I was gonna say something.

198
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,704
Were you, really?

199
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,209
I do like it.

200
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,379
Thanks.

201
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,133
So...

202
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,678
...dinner tomorrow night?

203
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,598
I told Marie that we'd come over
and eat with them.

204
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,645
Think maybe you'll be free?

205
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,024
Yeah.

206
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,445
Yeah, we can do that. That'll be nice.

207
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,156
Good.

208
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,539
Marie says it's about the only thing
that'll get Hank out of his room.

209
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,792
Mom?

210
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:20,054
- Hey, Mom? Dad?
- Hey, son.

211
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,268
Where are you?

212
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,105
We're back here.
We'll be out in a minute.

213
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,734
Oh, God.

214
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,324
- Seriously?
- I'm parked in the driveway.

215
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:44,329
This is going to make for some
very interesting dinner conversation.

216
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:49,751
He is definitely gonna ask
about our living situation now.

217
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,797
Maybe...

218
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,676
Maybe you should move back in.

219
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:03,723
You know, just so it's easier
to explain to everyone.

220
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,435
You think?

221
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,126
I have to get back to work.

222
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,921
You know, schedule.

223
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,799
Yeah.

224
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,498
Damn it.

225
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,916
Hey!

226
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,753
Hey! This is a two-man job.
I can't do it alone.

227
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,046
I'm done. That's it.

228
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,842
Finished. Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

229
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,905
Jesse?

230
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,203
Where is Jesse?

231
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,331
I need him.
You people have me down here...

232
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,084
...trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself.

233
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:41,422
It's unacceptable.
It's dangerous and counterproductive.

234
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,010
Jesse operates the forklift, not me.

235
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,180
That's one of the many, many things
he does around the lab...

236
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,682
...that keeps us on schedule,
so I suggest...

237
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,393
...that you get him back
down here as soon as you...

238
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,854
Are you listening to me?

239
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,105
Hello?

240
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,412
Where do you want it?

241
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,275
This is it, right? Last stop?

242
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,193
Last stop?

243
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,239
Hey, I've been counting, yo.
No more pickups after...

244
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:59,620
Yeah.
I'm gonna need to be picked up. Now.

245
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:05,835
Garcia's on Central. Honk once.
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

246
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,008
Cancel that.

247
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,395
Hey, this dude...

248
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,566
This dude was coming right at me
with a shotgun.

249
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,737
They blocked the alley and they were
gonna rip us off. I didn't have a choice.

250
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:38,242
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car, and just...

251
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,870
I saw.

252
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,538
You saw.

253
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,040
Jesus.

254
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,084
I just...

255
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,420
I don't know.

256
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,014
Go ahead, kid.

257
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,017
Smoke up.

258
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,184
Morning.

259
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,603
Hey. Good morning, son.

260
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,022
You want me
to pour you some juice?

261
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,274
I'll take a coffee.

262
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,195
Didn't know
you started drinking coffee.

263
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:02,284
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces too, all by myself.

264
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,912
Go grab a mug.

265
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,755
Milk? Sugar?

266
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,216
Just black.

267
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,094
Black. I like it.

268
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,517
Hey, Dad, I just gotta say...

269
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:32,064
I just wanted to say
it's really cool to have you here.

270
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,276
Thank you, son.

271
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,862
It's cool to be back home.

272
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,989
It just feels...

273
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:44,451
Mom said you're moving back in
this Tuesday.

274
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,247
She...?

275
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,457
She said that?

276
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,418
Yeah.

277
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,004
Tuesday, is it?

278
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,466
How about that?

279
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,747
Jesse. Jesse.

280
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,124
Yo, what's up?

281
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,043
What are you doing?

282
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,297
- Breaking ice.
- I mean, what are you doing here?

283
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,092
- Where's your car?
- Mike dropped me off.

284
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,606
Jesse.

285
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,858
Jesse!

286
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,320
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

287
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,864
I was out with Mike,
helped him make pickups.

288
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,117
- Picking up what?
- Cash. Dead drops.

289
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,996
Mike made the pickups
and I guarded him.

290
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,831
You...

291
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,291
...guarded Mike?

292
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,543
What is this, a joke?

293
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,838
Hey, know what? Two dudes tried
to rob us and I saved the stash.

294
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:24,385
I took care of business, just like
I'm taking care of business right now.

295
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,555
You wanna stand there dicking around,
or you wanna suit up and get to work?

296
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,185
Get in gear, yo, because I'm
meeting up with Mike this afternoon.

297
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,229
What, again? why?

298
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,399
Guess I have two jobs now.

299
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,459
Los Polios Hermanos,
can I take your order?

300
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,177
Any injuries?

301
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:10,889
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

302
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:15,978
It all went like you thought it would,
more or less.

303
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:20,691
I will, of course, reimburse you
for the damage to your vehicles.

304
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,112
Questions?

305
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,990
More than a few, yeah.

306
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,075
But I know better than to ask.

307
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,746
Anyway...

308
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,331
...just like you wanted.

309
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,876
The kid's a hero.

310
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,772
Just the idea of owning a car wash
seems so daunting, but I have to...

311
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,400
Who is just the most beautiful little girl
in the world? You.

312
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,236
So coming into a business
that's up and running...

313
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,698
...fully operational,
puts us way ahead of the game.

314
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,409
We're gonna still have some
changeover time.

315
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,078
We'll have to hire some people.

316
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,789
But we do have a staff in place,
so, you know...

317
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,125
...we'll be able to hold on
to most of Bogdan's employees.

318
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,712
We might lose a few
to the UltraWash across town, though.

319
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,173
They're making a grab, I hear.

320
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,509
- Gonna put the kid to work?
- I've got school.

321
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,805
Not you. I'm talking about your baby
sister. I wouldn't let you near my car.

322
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,307
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.

323
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,976
You should put Holly on the sign.

324
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,730
- Like a mascot?
- Like the Gerber baby.

325
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,192
I would get my car washed there
if I saw her face out front.

326
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,443
What about me?

327
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:50,447
The goal is to bring customers in,
not scare them away, so...

328
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,453
Walt, there's another bottle
in the kitchen. Just help yourself.

329
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,163
Good.

330
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,543
Maybe we could roll Uncle Hank
through the car wash.

331
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,045
He could be the first customer.

332
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,549
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

333
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,552
I got your wipe-down right here.

334
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,931
Hank, can we get through one meal
without you grabbing your crotch?

335
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,852
So, what are you gonna do with Holly?
You can't take her to work...

336
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,939
...with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

337
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:27,359
- Marie...
- What? That can't be safe.

338
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,195
Fortunately, five minutes
from the car wash...

339
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,782
...there is the top child-care center
in the city.

340
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,161
The National Child Care Association
gives it high ratings.

341
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,999
So that's a huge relief and, you know,
we could walk there if we had to.

342
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:47,421
Sky, I gotta tell you, I'm just...
I'm really, really impressed.

343
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:51,842
You came together on this.
I'm happy that it's working out for you.

344
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,554
It's been a little scary,
but it needed to be done.

345
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,848
And we get possession of the keys
tomorrow.

346
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,684
Oh, that's awesome.

347
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:04,313
I can't wait to see what kind of car
I'm going to get for my birthday...

348
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,356
...now with all this money rolling in.

349
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,401
You've been spending too much time
around your Uncle Hank.

350
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,487
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Right, Uncle Hank?

351
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,741
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

352
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,828
Hey, Nick the Greek,
you gonna share that bottle or what?

353
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,330
Yeah. Sorry.

354
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,956
Who's Nick the Greek?

355
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,209
He's a famous big-time card player.

356
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,877
Hank, that's not funny.

357
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,546
- What? it's a compliment.
- That's even worse, then.

358
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,049
You're giving
positive reinforcement...

359
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,553
...to behavior that Walt
is working very, very hard to change.

360
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,806
- Right, Skyler?
- Yeah.

361
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,143
I don't see how it's bad.
Dad's raking in the beaucoup bucks.

362
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,939
You know, I just think
maybe we could change the subject?

363
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,944
Yeah. Sure. You know. Absolutely.

364
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,988
Hey, Uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at...

365
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,783
...with that crazy singing guy?

366
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,371
I'm off that. I gave my assessment
to A.P.D. I'm done.

367
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,082
The case of the crazy singing guy.

368
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,125
Sounds like
an Encyclopedia Brown story.

369
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:11,171
Crazy is the wrong word.

370
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:15,717
This guy, Gale Boetticher,
he was eccentric.

371
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:20,597
A real character, you know?
He's dead now.

372
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,393
- Who was he?
- He was a meth cook.

373
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,561
He was a meth chef.

374
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:32,109
I mean, we're talking five stars.
Candles and white tablecloth.

375
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,862
Hey, I can't believe these words
are gonna come out of my mouth...

376
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:40,492
...but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

377
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:45,455
I mean, boy, if he had applied that
big brain of his to something good...

378
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,583
...who knows, he could've helped
humanity or something.

379
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:53,422
I mean, how many actual geniuses
are there in the world, right?

380
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,259
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction, who knows?

381
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,261
Hank...

382
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:04,933
...not to tell you your business,
but I'm not sure I agree.

383
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,768
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean...

384
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,731
...you showed me that notebook,
and from what I saw...

385
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,066
And this is just my humble opinion.

386
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,486
From what I saw on those papers...

387
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,156
Genius?

388
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,117
Not so much.

389
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,413
I mean, there was no reasoning,
no deductions in those pages.

390
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,916
So to my eye, all his brilliance...

391
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,922
...looks like nothing more
than just simple rote copying.

392
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,634
Probably of someone else's work.

393
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,765
Believe me, I have been around
enough students to know.

394
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,563
This genius of yours...

395
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,276
...maybe he's still out there.

396
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,874
- Hank.
- Hey, babe.

397
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:17,255
Tim stopped by. He brought over
some file boxes on that case.

398
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,633
- Thought I'd take another peek.
- That's great.

399
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,178
Sorry about the mess.

400
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,722
No, no, no. Don't be.

401
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,850
You want me to make some coffee?

402
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,644
Yeah.

403
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,687
Yeah, that'd be good.

404
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,595
You find something?

405
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,643
Oh, just this guy I'm looking at.

406
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,230
You know,
everything he buys and eats...

407
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,860
...is organic, fair trade, vegan.

408
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,576
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?
