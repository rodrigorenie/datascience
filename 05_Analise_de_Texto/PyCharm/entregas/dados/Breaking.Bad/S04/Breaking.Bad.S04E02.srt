1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,634
So how's it look?

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,970
Meaning, do I see it?

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,348
Yes.

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,059
Do you see it?

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,483
Basically, any lawman worth his salt
is gonna spot that, yeah.

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,486
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,406
Yes, it's a deal breaker.

8
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:38,121
Well, if stealth
is what you're aspiring to...

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,792
...you best go
with something more compact.

10
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,711
Thirty-eight Special.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,920
Snub nose.

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,755
Got a concealed hammer...

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,591
...so it don't catch on your belt
when you draw.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,886
Tried and true.
No nonsense about it.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,724
- Five shots.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,726
Automatic has how many?

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,145
Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,648
If you can't get it done with five,
you're into spray and pray...

19
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,861
...in which case, I wouldn't count
on another six closing the deal.

20
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,864
You load that
with 158-grain hollow points...

21
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,993
...instead of standard wadcutters,
it's got plenty of stopping power.

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,705
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

23
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,086
Try it on with this.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,011
That snubbie will conceal up real nice
if you carry it lWB.

25
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,264
Little harder to draw from,
but there's no substitute...

26
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,267
...if you're intent
on fooling a vigilant eye.

27
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,020
Comes in polymer too.

28
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,731
I prefer the feel of leather.

29
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,400
Old school, I guess.

30
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,655
Sure it's on the correct side?

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,616
If you're right-handed, it is.

32
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,202
I don't know, ma... Are you sure?

33
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,163
Maybe it'll feel better
on the left side.

34
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,749
General rule,
you don't wanna cross-draw.

35
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,251
Not unless you're gonna be sitting.

36
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,047
You know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

37
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,143
Either way, you're gonna wanna
practice your draw. A lot.

38
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,562
Because if you're all fingers...

39
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,233
...well, it might could be him
keeping the peace instead of you.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,026
Catch my drift?

41
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,781
What's this?

42
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,826
That is why you're gonna pay me
five times...

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,745
...what you'd pay
your neighborhood gun store.

44
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,458
Serial number's been filed off.

45
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,505
So to state the obvious...

46
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,591
...I don't wanna be caught with this
on me.

47
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,177
No. To state the obvious, you don't.

48
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,891
You know, mister, I've been providing
my services for the past 30-odd years.

49
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,520
Think I'd learn better
than to ask a man his business...

50
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,106
...especially not one referred
by the lawyer.

51
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,316
But I do feel the urge to ask you...

52
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,903
...are we strictly talking defense
here?

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,907
Yes, absolutely.

54
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,117
Defense.

55
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,785
Why?

56
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,747
Because
if it's just personal protection...

57
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,667
...aside from a bucket of money...

58
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,504
...you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot...

59
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,967
...for carrying a weapon with a defaced
serial number if you buy it legally.

60
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:44,015
But if you did have to use it,
wouldn't it still be better to use one...

61
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,683
...that couldn't be traced?

62
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,268
This is the West, boss.

63
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,897
New Mexico's
not a retreat jurisdiction.

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,357
Man steps to you bent
on doing you harm...

65
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,528
...you got every right to plant your feet
and shoot to kill.

66
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:02,450
Some call it a moral right, and I do
include myself within that class.

67
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,079
All this to say,
I'm happy to take your money.

68
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,583
But if you're not a convicted felon...

69
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,711
...you might best be advised
to bear your arms...

70
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,589
...within the confines of the law.

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,305
It's for defense.

72
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,480
Defense.

73
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,990
I'll take it.

74
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,379
Thanks, Bonnie.

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,730
Jesse.

76
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,690
What's up, brother?

77
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,361
Dude, sounds like an earthquake
out there.

78
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,196
New sound system.

79
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,574
- Check it out.
- Bodacious subwoofers, yo.

80
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,326
Serious cannons.

81
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,745
Eighteen-inchers, six of them.

82
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,666
Aluminum cones, so they're
really, really, like, sonically neutral.

83
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,209
Tweeters are killer too.

84
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,754
Dig all them lines jumping around.
Psychedelic.

85
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,095
Kind of like just wanna stare
at them.

86
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:57,143
Yeah, man, totally makes me wanna
crank old Sabbath and blaze one.

87
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,687
It's got, like, parametric equalization.

88
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,941
Automatically adjusts the levels to
changes in air pressure and whatnot.

89
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,026
It's totally digital.

90
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,947
Vacuum tube amp, which is by far
the best, anti-distortion-wise.

91
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,450
Hits 120 decibels
without breaking a sweat.

92
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,162
Hold onto your hats, bitches.

93
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,726
Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting
yesterday.

94
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,103
She asked about you.

95
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,165
Thanks, man,
but 12 steps and all that.

96
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,626
Seriously?

97
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,106
Maybe just a little bump.

98
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,995
Left 4 Dead. Bitches get all cranial
when you cap them in the head, like:

99
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,458
No, no, no, man. Resident Evil 4
takes it by a long shot.

100
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,461
- Please, brother. You're fronting.
- No, seriously.

101
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,923
That chick, the one you gotta rescue?
She's smoking, bro.

102
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,301
And then you're, like,
the last undead dude on earth.

103
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,470
How can you not be dipping
into that?

104
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,348
Talk about inspiring a brother
to kick zombie ass.

105
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,435
They're trying to eat your brain.
A dude don't need no more motivation.

106
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,104
Fair point, I guess.

107
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,732
Okay, okay, okay.

108
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,568
Call of Duty: World at War,
zombie mode.

109
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,571
Now, that's the bomb, man.
Think on it, bro.

110
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,574
They're not just zombies,
they're Nazi zombies.

111
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,702
Nazi zombies.

112
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,996
Yeah, man. SS waffen troopers too...

113
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:26,208
...which are like the baddest ass Nazis
of the whole Nazi family.

114
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,129
What difference does it make what
their job was when they was living?

115
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,381
Dude,
you are so historically retarded.

116
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:37,011
Nazi zombies don't wanna eat you just
because they're craving the protein.

117
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,804
They do it because...

118
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,017
They do it
because they hate Americans, man.

119
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,896
Talibans. They're the Talibans
of the zombie world.

120
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,899
I played the game.
They ain't exactly fleet of foot.

121
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,027
I'm saying, where's the challenge?

122
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,071
The zombies in Left 4 Dead
clock a respectable 40.

123
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,907
- You gotta lead them.
- They're not even zombies.

124
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,451
They're just infected.

125
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,536
They got, like, this rage virus...

126
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,497
...amps them up
like they been smoking the schwag.

127
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,877
Apples and oranges, bro.
Totally unfair to compare the two.

128
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,133
Yo, Jesse,
where do you come out on all this?

129
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,930
Agree. Totally.

130
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,819
Did that just happen?

131
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,281
Damn, man.

132
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,742
It's quiet.

133
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,789
You know what this place needs?

134
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,713
You okay?

135
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,507
Fine.

136
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,134
Can't you sleep?

137
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,597
Actually, yes, Marie. This is me
sleeping. What's it look like?

138
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,059
It looks like you're looking at a rock.

139
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,270
At 2:24 in the morning.

140
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,816
This is not a rock, this is a mineral,
for, like, the 10th time.

141
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,194
Okay.

142
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,487
Got it.

143
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,739
Blue corundum, to be precise.

144
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,367
Blue corundum.
Well, it's very pretty.

145
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,579
It's encrusted with igneous biotite
in a mica schist.

146
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,124
Would you like some more detail?
Because I can give it to you.

147
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,379
You can keep acting
like you give the first shit...

148
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,838
Hank.

149
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,509
Found in the Central Cordillera
of lrian Jaya.

150
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,137
Blue corundum.

151
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,432
I'm just saying.

152
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,811
It's 2 in the morning.

153
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,356
I'm just asking if maybe...

154
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:03,652
You know, last I counted, Marie, there
were four bedrooms in this house.

155
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,244
You know, I mean,
if I'm keeping you awake and all.

156
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,412
You've reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

157
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,165
...number and reason for your call.
Thank you.

158
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,002
Walt?

159
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,963
Hello? Walt?

160
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,842
Okay, Walt,
could you call me back, please?

161
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,512
Hank's bills are really starting
to pile up here.

162
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,264
And in the meantime...

163
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,726
...I haven't received a check from you
in quite a while.

164
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,396
Second order of business
is the car wash.

165
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,608
- God!
- So it's time to take the next step here.

166
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,778
We need to look
into buying this car wash while we...

167
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,656
Skyler, what are you doing?

168
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,240
What do you mean?

169
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:37,913
- Wait, are you screening all my calls?
- No, no, no, I'm just...

170
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,583
What are you thinking leaving
a message like that on my machine?

171
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,460
What are you...? What did I say?

172
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:48,340
You just left recorded proof
of our intention to buy a car wash.

173
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,259
- Now, you think that was wise?
- Proof of our what?

174
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,928
What are you talking about?

175
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,556
Skyler, we should not even be
mentioning the words "car wash"...

176
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,433
...on the phone at all. Period.

177
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,895
Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel.

178
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,982
I mean, if we can't even say what it is,
why are we buying it at all?

179
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,235
God, look, Skyler, please, just...

180
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,529
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, hon.

181
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,907
Look, there's some cereal
on the breakfast table.

182
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,579
I'm telling you,
if you're not willing to pull the trigger...

183
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,249
...I'm more than happy
to call Goodman myself.

184
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,044
No, no, no, I will handle it, okay?

185
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,321
I could so use a brain transplant
right now.

186
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,407
Yeah. I'm going to work.

187
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,161
Wake up, bitch.

188
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,956
Damn.

189
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,378
You're way too sensitive
about your zone, bro.

190
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,840
Come on, man. Cleanup time.

191
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,468
Right on. Least we can do.

192
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,847
Hey, the hell with cleaning up.

193
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,768
Just go out
and get everybody some breakfast.

194
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,897
Stock up on liquor while you're at it.
Keep this party going.

195
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,232
I mean it, yo.

196
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,653
I mean, I want this place kicking harder
than a sensei when I get back.

197
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,031
- All right.
- You got it, bro.

198
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,875
Come on, damn it!

199
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,378
Wake up and party!

200
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,889
Hello.

201
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,060
- Yo, you the new guy?
- Yeah.

202
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,895
You got something for me?

203
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,274
Two hundred and one point six.

204
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,072
What's the count?

205
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,324
Two-oh-one point six.

206
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,535
Give it a second weigh,
if you would, please.

207
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,704
New policy.

208
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,043
What, waiter?

209
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,964
- Where's Gus?
- Why?

210
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,801
Because I would like to speak
with him.

211
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:51,643
Because the way we left things,
I would like the chance to clear the air.

212
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,772
What?

213
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,859
Walter,
you're never gonna see him again.

214
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,583
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

215
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,043
Are you hungry?

216
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,546
Yeah, that's good. Drink that up.

217
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,382
Just a little longer,
okay, my sweetie?

218
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,259
Okay?

219
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,305
There you go.

220
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,766
Okay, now.

221
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:37,397
The Dodge gets a detail...

222
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:42,068
...and the Corolla...

223
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,030
...gets a hand wax.

224
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,365
Right? Hand wax.

225
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,200
Okay.

226
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,955
Hello. Hello. Just a few more minutes
and then we're on our way home.

227
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,915
Okay, my sweet girl?

228
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,835
Mama's just doing her work here.

229
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,337
Mama's doing her work.

230
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,137
Way to go, Hank.

231
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,765
Come on, way to soldier up.

232
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,394
You're doing it. Come on.

233
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,439
Another few yards.

234
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,232
Dig.

235
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,820
Jesus.

236
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,407
Look at you. Way to go, honey.

237
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,077
Come on. Come on, Hank.

238
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,537
Keep it going.

239
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,584
Just ten more steps.

240
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,960
Nine.

241
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,254
Eight.

242
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,758
Seven.

243
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,095
- Six.
- Six.

244
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,973
You're almost there, Hank.

245
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,316
All right, buddy.
That's what I call kicking some ass.

246
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,361
Oh, that was awesome, babe.

247
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,404
- Hells, yeah.
- Very nice.

248
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,906
Yeah!

249
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,866
Hey!

250
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,206
You're a good man, Chuck. Thanks.

251
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,333
It's an honor, my friend.

252
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,876
Same time tomorrow?

253
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,253
Damned straight...

254
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,296
...if I'm still alive.

255
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,384
Great session.
Lots of positive energy.

256
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,302
Lots.

257
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,806
It's just... it's so great to see that.

258
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,350
It's just...

259
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,768
Yeah.

260
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,312
One day at a time.

261
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,939
All we can do.

262
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,233
I know. it's just...

263
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,193
You've got a real way with him.

264
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,195
It's...

265
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,200
You wanna go full time?
We've got a spare bedroom.

266
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,286
I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,255
Wow, you were so strong today.

268
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,924
Did you work up an appetite?
I'm sure you did.

269
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,802
Listen, I was thinking
about cooking tonight, so...

270
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,262
Marie.

271
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,807
Get out.

272
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,499
Oh, yo, about time. Oh, my God.

273
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,338
Yo, what's up with the pie, man?
It ain't cut.

274
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,341
- Yeah, right. That's the gimmick.
- What gimmick?

275
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,511
This place, they don't cut their pizza,
they pass the savings on to you.

276
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,805
How much can it be
to cut a damn pizza?

277
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,974
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro.

278
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,478
You know, cut your own
Christmas tree, cut your own pizza.

279
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,146
Yeah, it's democratic.

280
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,524
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Don't sweat it.

281
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,027
You got some, like, scissors?

282
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,946
I will cut this bitch up good.

283
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,532
Yo, come in.

284
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,368
Hey, would you...?

285
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,747
Gotta figure, you make, like,
10 million pizzas a year.

286
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,542
Each pizza takes, like,
10 seconds to cut?

287
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,045
In man-hours, that's...

288
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,381
I don't know.

289
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,174
A lot?

290
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,509
Hey, Jesse?

291
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,053
You got...

292
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,389
Yeah.

293
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,875
So how you doing?

294
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,920
I'm dealing.

295
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,965
How's Brock?

296
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,552
Good. He's...

297
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,850
Brock, honey, wait in the car, okay?
Let the grown-ups speak.

298
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,811
Go on, little man.
We'll catch up later.

299
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,652
Guess you know I've been calling.

300
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,488
Yeah.

301
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,741
I'm really busy at work and...

302
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,995
Jesse, I'm not here
to make you come up with excuses.

303
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,666
You got other things going on.
I get it.

304
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,794
There's just one thing
you and me gotta talk about.

305
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,672
And that's this.

306
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,593
After Tomas was murdered,
two dudes...

307
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,262
...bangers he used to hang with,
get run over.

308
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,768
One of them shot in the head.
Same night, I get this in my mailbox.

309
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,026
This was you?

310
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,080
You know what?

311
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,501
Whatever it is you had to do with my
brother's killers, I don't wanna know.

312
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,587
But you gotta tell me one thing...

313
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,095
No.

314
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,353
What exactly am I supposed to do
with this?

315
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,358
Use it to get you and Brock out
of that shit hole of a neighborhood.

316
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,112
Or you can go out
and spend it on glass...

317
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,489
...and I'd have no way
of stopping you.

318
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,411
But I gotta believe
you won't do that.

319
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,621
Go home, Walter.

320
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,732
How you doing?

321
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,900
Hi.

322
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,402
Ton of bricks?

323
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,739
Rocks.

324
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,951
You want me to wheel them inside?

325
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,828
Thank you.

326
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,338
Marie, is that my minerals?

327
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,839
Yes, Hank.

328
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,049
How many boxes?

329
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,219
I don't know. Three, four hundred.

330
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,388
A million.

331
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,806
I don't know.

332
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,933
Did you check them for damage?

333
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,352
Oh, my God.

334
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,730
- They're rocks, Hank.
- No, they're minerals.

335
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:07,068
Jesus, Marie. I got some geodes
coming that are very delicate, all right?

336
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,570
I'll not accept any boxes
that have damage.

337
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,699
Those delivery jagoffs, I'm not getting
ass-raped by those bastards.

338
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,368
Just...

339
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,246
Honey, would you check?

340
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,041
Just check, please?

341
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,971
Hey, you, too much wax.

342
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,682
Stop wasting it.

343
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,227
Look, tell your brother
that if he doesn't show up tomorrow...

344
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:44,105
...I'm gonna have to fire him.
So now, go back.

345
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,148
And no more excuses.

346
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,945
Mr. wolynetz,
my name is Skyler White.

347
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,822
How do you do?

348
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,330
- You wanna buy my car wash?
- I do.

349
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:05,251
And I am prepared to talk numbers
right now, if you'd like.

350
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,837
You think this is an easy job?

351
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,549
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees...

352
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,552
...and scrub like a housemaid...

353
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,013
...with all the chemicals
eating into your nice skin...

354
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,765
...and stinging in your eyes?

355
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,561
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

356
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,106
Any other advice for me?
Because I am serious about this.

357
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,566
Good.

358
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,901
I am serious too.

359
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,156
I have worked 30 years on building
this business from nothing...

360
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,492
...with my own hands
and my own sweat and blood.

361
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,745
I can appreciate that. Truly.

362
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,080
So with that in mind...

363
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,791
...is there a figure you can quote me?

364
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,626
One which you think would...

365
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,962
Ten million dollars.

366
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,056
Well, let's try 879,000.

367
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,019
Where do you come up with this
number? You pull it from your behind?

368
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,152
On a typical day,
you average 19 cars per hour.

369
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,406
Extrapolating, I added the extra
revenues for hand waxes and detailing.

370
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,617
Subtracted your overhead in salary...

371
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,369
...maintenance,
operating fees, depreciation...

372
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,790
...which I obtained from businesses
in Albuquerque area...

373
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,376
...giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here.

374
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:34,673
I applied industry-standard multiplier,
added market value of your real estate.

375
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:39,553
Giving me a total estimated value
of $829,000.

376
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:45,267
On top of which I generously added
an extra $50,000.

377
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,312
So as not to be insulting.

378
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,482
Twenty million dollars.

379
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,944
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this...

380
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,738
This is the price for Walter White.

381
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,910
Oh, yes.
You don't think I know who you are?

382
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,245
I remember.

383
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,915
- Well, I have not pretended to be a...
- Your husband.

384
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,584
He quit without giving me notice.

385
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:15,548
He broke my air fresheners,
he cursed at me, and grabbed himself.

386
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,925
And now he wants
to buy my car wash.

387
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,512
But he's not man enough
to come in here and face me himself.

388
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,848
- Instead he sends his woman.
- Excuse me.

389
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,684
Walter White wants
to buy my car wash.

390
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,896
The price he pays
is 20 million dollars.

391
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,106
Now, please leave.

392
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,166
Have you recently lost a loved one
in an aviation disaster?

393
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,587
Have you suffered injury,
shock to the senses...

394
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,048
...or property damage
as a result of airplane debris...

395
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,634
...or, God forbid, falling body parts?

396
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,012
Then call me, Saul Goodman.

397
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,681
It goes without saying,
that the six, seven...

398
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,393
...perhaps eight-figure
cash settlement that I can win for you...

399
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,439
...will never fill the hole in your heart
caused by your tragic loss.

400
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,191
But you deserve justice.

401
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,361
So if you want to tip the scales
back in your favor...

402
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,946
...better call Saul.

403
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:25,284
Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law.
505-503-4455.

404
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,704
We are just about ready to go...

405
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,020
You might wanna learn
how to tail better...

406
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,106
...if you're planning
on making a habit of it.

407
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,861
May I buy you a drink?

408
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,907
Next round, when you're done.

409
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,453
Why not?
You make a hell of a lot more than I do.

410
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,712
Another round for him,
and I'll have the same.

411
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,422
No ice.

412
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:32,518
I feel like I need to explain myself.

413
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,939
There were some actions that I took
which I want you to understand.

414
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,111
I didn't want any of this to happen.

415
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,617
Everything I did,
I did out of loyalty to my partner.

416
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,328
And then, later...

417
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,330
...of course...

418
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,166
...purely out of self-defense.

419
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,794
I hope you can appreciate that.

420
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,131
Just like I appreciated that...

421
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:10,514
I appreciate
that when you were going to kill me...

422
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,935
...you were simply following orders.
I get that. Completely.

423
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,062
And I harbor no ill will.

424
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,275
Well, there's a load off my mind.

425
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,696
- Mike, I'm trying to tell you...
- I get it.

426
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,156
Fine.

427
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,450
Drink up, Walter.

428
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,424
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

429
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,888
Makes a man wonder exactly
where he stands.

430
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:05,194
I mean, I cannot be alone
in feeling this way.

431
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,988
Not after what happened to Victor.

432
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:16,622
So, what's with the piece?

433
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,750
Right hip, inside your waistband.

434
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:24,922
I noticed it the other day at the lab.
You wear it if it makes you feel better.

435
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,258
But if push comes to shove,
it's not gonna help.

436
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,595
Mike, do I have to come right out
and say this?

437
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,640
You and I...

438
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,391
...we're in the same boat.

439
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,810
Drink your drink.

440
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,063
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

441
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,899
And what the hell was that, anyway?

442
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,734
A message?

443
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,029
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

444
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,281
You won, Walter.

445
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,867
You got the job.

446
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,956
Do yourself a favor
and learn to take yes for an answer.

447
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,458
Yeah, I got the job.

448
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,210
But for how long?

449
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,968
Get me in a room with him.

450
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,764
Mike, just get me in a room...

451
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,475
...and I'll do the rest.

452
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,109
You done?

453
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,073
Yeah.

454
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,651
Thanks for the drink.

455
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,543
Pinkman, man,
you know how to party, brother.

456
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,213
Epic. Epic.

457
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,090
Seriously? Where you two going?

458
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,220
Jesse, I've been awake
for, like, three straight days.

459
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,263
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

460
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,723
So crash here.

461
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,934
It's not like I ain't got the space.

462
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:46,313
Yeah, that's cool and all,
but I think I got, like, this cat.

463
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:50,317
Think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.

464
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,861
Whatever, you little bitch.
What about you?

465
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:56,531
You sticking or do I gotta flip you over,
check you for a slizz?

466
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,243
Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here,
yo.

467
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,329
I ain't proud of it,
but it's God's honest truth.

468
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,083
Hell, brother,
you know we got mad love for you.

469
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:10,671
Now that you're back in the mix,
it's, like, nothing but good days ahead.

470
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,218
Plenty of time to pace it out,
is all I'm saying.

471
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,553
Yeah, man.

472
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,973
Totally.

473
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,811
I was thinking, like, next week?

474
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,772
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.

475
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,649
We cool?

476
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,943
We are cool.
