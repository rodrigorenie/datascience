1
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,525
What did you say to Gus?

2
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,112
- Because he's on to us. Yeah.
- What do you mean he's on to us?

3
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,282
He's walking to his car,
then suddenly he isn't.

4
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,284
What, does he have a sixth sense?

5
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,202
Jesus. What did you say to him?

6
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,789
Could I ask my own question right now
at this point?

7
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,459
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

8
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,920
What, was I supposed to leave it
on his car?

9
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,840
What, you're supposed to bring it
to a hospital?

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,884
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,343
Look.

12
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,721
Where can we find Gus?

13
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,724
Name a place. One place
where I can surprise him...

14
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,351
...where he won't see me coming.

15
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,355
Because his house, the laundry...

16
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,692
...the restaurant, factory farm,
all wired with cameras.

17
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,819
One place.

18
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,822
Think. Jesse, think.

19
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,908
Where is it? Where?

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,577
Because if you can't tell me...

21
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,662
...we are dead.

22
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,132
Jesse?

23
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,551
I don't... I don't know.

24
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,678
Well, maybe...

25
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,306
Excuse me. Jesse Pinkman?

26
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,559
- Yeah.
- Hi. Detective Kalanchoe.

27
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,020
Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

28
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:30,233
We were wondering if we could have
a few minutes. Go someplace and talk.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,484
About what?

30
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,278
- Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
- About what?

31
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,155
It concerns Brock Cantillo...

32
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,616
...and a statement you made
to his mother.

33
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,368
How about you come with us?

34
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,579
We just wanna clear a few things up,
no big deal.

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,412
- So am I under arrest?
- No, you're not under arrest.

36
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,746
We're just talking.

37
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,958
So if I get tired of talking,
can I get up and leave?

38
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,460
We'd prefer you didn't.

39
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,170
- You'd prefer.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,675
Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom
that the boy had been poisoned?

41
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,347
Look, I think this has been,
you know...

42
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,975
...what do call it? Overblown.

43
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,977
Because all I basically said was:

44
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,315
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

45
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,442
In a cover-all-bases kind of sense.

46
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,696
Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
You helping them out like that.

47
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,781
Especially how specific you were.

48
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,909
Ricin, wow.

49
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,621
Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
You don't see that every day.

50
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,041
So when doctors hear that,
they take it very seriously.

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,084
As do we.

52
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,254
- As does the FBI.
- Okay.

53
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,049
Nice, you trying to help out
like that and all.

54
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,345
You know, professional courtesy,
sharing your expertise.

55
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,974
Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right?
I just, you know...

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,435
You happened
to guess this rare poison...

57
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,813
...might be the thing
that put this boy in the hospital.

58
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,276
Congratulations. Because his doctors,
they think that you might just be right.

59
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,738
So why ricin?
Jesse, how'd you come up with that?

60
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:45,826
I think I've... I don't know, I must've
saw it on House or something.

61
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,122
Yeah, you know, like, House
or the Discovery Channel.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,209
Sometimes your brain
just makes these connections.

63
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,211
- Does it?
- Mine does.

64
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,129
That's interesting.

65
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,840
Look, I gotta get back.

66
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,218
But we're still talking.

67
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,764
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

68
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,893
So then, I guess...

69
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,396
...I should call my lawyer, right?

70
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,524
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

71
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,443
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

72
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,113
You know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,657
Suddenly,
everything's a big pissing match.

74
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,951
- Like, every time.
- Adversarial.

75
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,578
Adversarial.
Then we gotta book you. Right?

76
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,665
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,917
You're no Boy Scout.

78
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,879
Saul Goodman.

79
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,923
That's my guy.

80
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,593
So do I gotta call him or do you?

81
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,299
What the hell are you doing?

82
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,843
- I need Saul. Right now.
- So you break in?

83
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,387
- You just break in.
- I see you're here.

84
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,349
If you'd answer the phone or the door,
maybe I wouldn't... Forget it.

85
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,143
Is he here?

86
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,063
Is that a serious question?
Why would he be here?

87
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,565
But you know where he is.
I need a number.

88
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,485
Look, let me explain something
to you.

89
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,987
- My partner and I...
- Are in danger?

90
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,990
Whoopty-freakingdoo.
Why do you think he's not here?

91
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,994
And how's that news, exactly,
the two of you being in danger?

92
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,829
After doing something idiotic?

93
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,665
What gives you the right
to break down my door?

94
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,335
Look, I just need a number, okay?
That's all.

95
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,255
You are such a pain in my ass,
you know that?

96
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,383
You're the reason
I gotta go on unemployment.

97
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,178
I was looking forward
to getting out of here.

98
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,014
But, no,
now I gotta wait around all day...

99
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,226
...for a guy to come fix this door.
Who pays for this?

100
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay, you know what?

101
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,773
Here, look, I'm giving you everything.
All of it, okay?

102
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,066
There's one, two...

103
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,153
Look, there's gotta be at least
1700 dollars there, okay?

104
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,865
More than cover the cost of the door.
Now, I apologize profusely.

105
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,368
Please. The phone number.

106
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,997
A door like this is gonna cost
way more than 1700.

107
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,500
What, for a plate of glass? No.

108
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,002
Oh, yeah. I bet it does.

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,964
I bet you it winds up costing...

110
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,550
...20,000.

111
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,137
Are you insane?

112
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:56,016
Who the hell is going to charge
$20,000 for a plate-glass door?

113
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,769
There's no reputable vendor would...

114
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,403
Now I'm thinking 25.

115
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,911
I'll be right back.

116
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,232
Yes. Albuquerque, New Mexico.

117
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,654
The number of Rebecca Simmons,
306 Negra Arroyo Lane.

118
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,741
Would you connect it for me, please?
Thank you.

119
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,957
Becky, hi. it's waiter White.

120
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,750
Listen, I wo...

121
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,462
I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?

122
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,048
Oh, good, good.

123
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,300
Yes, cats are...

124
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,677
Listen.

125
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,888
Skyler and I are out of town,
on our way to Santa Fe...

126
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,350
...and Junior just told us
that he thinks...

127
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,020
...he may have left the burner on
on the stove.

128
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,649
Yes, God forbid, there's a fire.

129
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,903
Well, that's why I'm calling.
You se... l just wanted to ask...

130
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,740
...and I'm sorry to do this,
but do you still have the key?

131
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,703
You do? Good.
And would you be willing to...?

132
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,748
Oh, you are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

133
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,418
Yes. Okay.

134
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,672
Okay. I'll await your call.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

135
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,939
There you go.

136
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,734
Becky?

137
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,157
Oh, that's good. That's a relief.

138
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,036
I owe you one. Bigtime.

139
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,772
So how's he doing?

140
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,945
You could at least say, instead
of being a couple dicks about it.

141
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,033
Jesse, if you care at all
about that little boy...

142
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,202
...prove it to me.

143
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,162
Tell us what you know.

144
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,748
- I told you what I know.
- Tell us again.

145
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:57,044
What are you, like, broken records?

146
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,713
I was trying to be helpful.

147
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,798
End of story.

148
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,969
Guess we'll wait and see
what the tox screen says.

149
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,601
Look at this. isn't this cozy?
What'd you tell them?

150
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,229
I told them they're a couple of dicks.

151
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,438
He's a wordsmith.

152
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,025
Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go...

153
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,196
...make like you got manners,
make like you respect the rule of law.

154
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,326
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,
hasta luego, get the hell out.

155
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,413
Bye-bye. That's it, pick it up.
Follow your partner.

156
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,290
And one-two.

157
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,167
Thank you.

158
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,378
Christ. You two...?

159
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,257
If I ever get anal polyps,
I'll know what to name them.

160
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,551
Are you gonna get me out of here?

161
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,389
No. Not even if I could.

162
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,017
You know, the FBl's gonna show up
on this ricin thing...

163
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,437
...and then you're in it
for the duration.

164
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,274
You're a lot safer in here.

165
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,985
They tried to get your partner
in his own home.

166
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,195
Jesus.

167
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,655
Is he okay?

168
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,492
Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.

169
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,537
Now, we're all on the clock here
and thanks for that.

170
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,290
Wanna go stick your wangs
in a hornet's nest...

171
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,877
...it's a free country. But how come
I always get sloppy seconds, huh?

172
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,716
You got anything for me? Tell me
I didn't poke my head up for nothing.

173
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,636
Yeah.

174
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,680
I've been thinking...

175
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,724
And?

176
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,768
Casa Tranquila.

177
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,270
What's Casa Tranquila?

178
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,814
It's an old folks' home
off Paseo Del Norte.

179
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,318
Our boy tells me Fring took him
to visit one of the patients.

180
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,154
Someone Pinkman says
you'll definitely remember:

181
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,323
Tio Salamanca.

182
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,327
Old guy in a wheelchair?

183
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,624
Doesn't talk, rings a bell.

184
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,792
I mean, does that ring a bell?

185
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,964
- The guy actually has to ring a bell.
- Yes, I know. I remember.

186
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,468
So, what, once every blue moon...

187
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,388
...Gus goes and visits
an old cartel associate.

188
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,350
That doesn't help me.

189
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,353
I can't hide out in a nursing home
for six months...

190
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,523
...hoping on the off chance
that he comes back.

191
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,401
It's not even like they're friends.

192
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,946
Pinkman said it was like
he was torturing the old guy.

193
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,032
What does that mean?

194
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,870
He told him the last of his family
was dead. He enjoyed telling him.

195
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,831
Pinkman asked him about it.
All Gus would say...

196
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,418
...was that this Tio character
murdered someone close to him.

197
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,339
Wait.
Tio murdered someone close to Gus?

198
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,717
I know,
it sounds not particularly fruitful.

199
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,971
But, sorry, that's all I got.

200
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,102
They're enemies, not friends.

201
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,565
Next number in this cover-all game
where you cover the whole shimoly...

202
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:10,529
...is B number three,
like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

203
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,199
That's number three
in your B column.

204
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,412
Followed by So..., seven, four...

205
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,875
...that's So..., 74,
on the other side of your card.

206
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,549
Now we have
that lucky number B, number seven.

207
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,176
Is it lucky for you?

208
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,178
B, seven.

209
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,973
In the I row, two, one.

210
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,225
L, 21.

211
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,019
I know you despise me.

212
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,815
And I know how badly
you wanna see me dead.

213
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,278
But I'm willing to bet that I know a man
whom you hate even more.

214
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,865
Those N's just keep coming.
They're all sticking together.

215
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,619
I'm offering you an opportunity
for revenge.

216
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,913
G column, four, eight...

217
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,126
...the continental United States,
excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

218
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,231
Okay. I'm here.

219
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,902
How you doing this morning,
Mr. Salamanca? You need something?

220
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,321
You need to go poopie, huh?

221
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,823
Did you go poopie already? No?

222
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,658
What do you need?

223
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,036
You want me to get
the board for you?

224
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,662
Okay.

225
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,957
All right.

226
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay. Here we go.

227
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,675
A, E, I...

228
00:18:55,843 --> 00:19:01,515
Row I. I, J, K, L, M, N...

229
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,558
First letter N.

230
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,310
A, E...

231
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,606
Row E. E... Second letter E.

232
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,400
A, E... Row E.

233
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,487
E... Next letter E.

234
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,781
A... Row A.

235
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:21,743
A, B, C, D...

236
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,870
Next letter D.

237
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,956
A... Row A.

238
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,668
A, B, C, D...

239
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,461
Next letter D.

240
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,089
A, E... Row E.

241
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,133
E... E.

242
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,052
A... Row A.

243
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,638
A... Next letter A.

244
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:46,601
A, E, I, So..., U...

245
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:55,151
I don't think we're finished,
Mr. Salamanca. A, E, I, So..., U.

246
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,113
Finish the word, Mr. Salamanca.

247
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,533
Is it "dear?"

248
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,370
Is it "deal?"

249
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,168
Honey, "dea" ain't a word.
Help me out here.

250
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,450
- Hey, son, what's up?
- When exactly are you getting here?

251
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,785
Just as soon as I can.

252
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,789
Look, this is a serious situation
and you're not taking it seriously.

253
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,999
Let me talk to him.

254
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,377
- Son, I am taking this seriously.
- Give it to me, waiter.

255
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,339
I'm concerned about your Uncle Hank
and his safety.

256
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,217
But whomever is making these threats
against him...

257
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,554
...I can assure you,
there's absolutely no interest in me.

258
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,514
I'm not on anyone's radar.

259
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,809
- And besides, your mother and I...
- Give it to me. waiter.

260
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,813
Did you hear what he said?
Get over here. No more excuses.

261
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,275
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

262
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,526
- I promise.
- Hold on.

263
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,198
You wanna weigh in here?
Maybe you can talk sense into him?

264
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,451
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here so...

265
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,873
I hope you sell plenty
of air fresheners.

266
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,334
I hope you have a banner day
over there.

267
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,921
Okay, walt, don't worry
about a thing here. Goodbye.

268
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,385
And thank you for all of your help.

269
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,136
What's that?

270
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,771
Anything?

271
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,540
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi, Steve.

272
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,626
- How's everybody holding out?
- The man I wanna see.

273
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,586
Come here. Look at this.

274
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,882
- Jesus, enough with the laundry.
- No, no, no, hear me out.

275
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,429
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly,
is 7200 amp service.

276
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,599
This place has two of them, right?
That's a whole lot of juice, brother.

277
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,477
Laundry this size, typically,
has half that, okay?

278
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,229
What's with the extra panel?

279
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,691
- What are you, Thomas Edison?
- Asked a bunch of electricians.

280
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,403
They have their own chat rooms,
all they talked about was wiring.

281
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,990
Freaking internet.
Find anything on it these days.

282
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,951
What do you say?
Pop over, have another look-see?

283
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,538
Listen.

284
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,751
I think we possibly have a lead
on something.

285
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,253
- Yeah?
- I have this guy down at the office.

286
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,672
He says he has some kind
of information.

287
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,093
The thing is, he'll only give it to you,
in person.

288
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,142
Okay.

289
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,811
- Do you remember Hector Salamanca?
- Yeah.

290
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,732
The old cripple guy with the bell?
Rather crap than talk to us?

291
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,319
- No, I don't remember him at all. why?
- Well, he's the guy.

292
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,990
His nurse calls us,
says he wants to powwow.

293
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,951
So we have this guy at the office
for three hours.

294
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,579
And he still just wants to talk to you.

295
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,875
Do not even think
about going down there.

296
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,753
- Marie...
- This is clearly a ploy or a trick...

297
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:46,174
...or something designed to get Hank
out into the open. That's all this is.

298
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,551
- Well, that's what we thought.
- Well...

299
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,262
it's been years
since this guy's been a player.

300
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,598
His nephew's gone,
doesn't have anybody.

301
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,351
The nurse checks out,
don't know nothing.

302
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,479
Guess I just don't see an angle
here...

303
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,356
...if there even is one.

304
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,234
Of course,
if you did wanna talk to this guy...

305
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,653
...there's no safer place
than the office.

306
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,697
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

307
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,282
Yeah. I agree, Uncle Hank.

308
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,660
It is a ridiculous idea.

309
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:18,164
And there's no way
that you're going to do it. End of story.

310
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,626
Hank, thanks for coming down.

311
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,128
No problem at all.

312
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,130
Good to see you, sir.

313
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:39,018
So, Mr. Salamanca,
you got something you wanna tell me?

314
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,948
A, E, I, So...

315
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,661
Row So... P, Q, R, S...

316
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,580
First letter S.

317
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:04,252
A, E, I, So..., U...

318
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,962
Second letter U.

319
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,881
A...

320
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,717

321
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,138
A, E, I...

322
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,807

323
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,895

324
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:26,399

325
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:31,988
A, E, I, So..., U...

326
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:37,327
Row U. V, W, X, Y...

327
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,870
All right. That's enough.

328
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,957
Thank you.

329
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,045
Yeah, thanks. I can spell.

330
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,007
Well, you got that out
of your system now?

331
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,676
Should we try this one more time?

332
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,393
A, E... F...

333
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:09,567
A, E, I, So..., U...

334
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,738
A...

335
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,907
B, C...

336
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,826
Yeah, we got it.

337
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,122
I am... l am... l am just so, so sorry.

338
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,342
Well, at least this time,
he didn't shit himself.

339
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,845
I guess that's progress.

340
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,418
- Yes?
- We may have a problem.

341
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,086
I've got eyes on the DEA.

342
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,714
They just had a visitor.

343
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,676
Hector Salamanca.

344
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,147
I don't know what to say to you now.

345
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,651
Sit here and think about how far that
kind of behavior is gonna get you.

346
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,237
Not far, let me tell you.

347
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,586
Any second thoughts?

348
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,299
Then let's get to work.

349
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,684
Hello.

350
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,662
Hi.

351
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,908
Hello.

352
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,869
Hi.

353
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,408
Mr. Pinkman...

354
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,410
...you're free to go.

355
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,539
Why? What happened?

356
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,332
Tox screen came back.

357
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,668
No ricin poisoning.

358
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,130
Surprised, huh?

359
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,759
No, why should I be?

360
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,594
Your jacket.

361
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,267
Till we meet again.

362
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,023
Okay. Okay.

363
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,277
Hey, yo. Yo, right here.

364
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,242
Hey, Andrea.

365
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,869
I'm just checking on Brock.

366
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,415
Hey, it sounds like...

367
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,710
I mean, listen,
just call me if you can, all right?

368
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,672
- I'm heading back over. All right.
- Hey, excuse me.

369
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:23,858
Yes.

370
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:27,486
We just picked up Pinkman.
No witnesses.

371
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,073
What about Hector?

372
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,909
I've checked inside and out...

373
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,667
Police cruiser rolled through
an hour ago. Seemed routine.

374
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,879
It's just him, alone in his room.

375
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,217
All right.

376
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,179
I'm on my way.

377
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:58,059
Maybe it's better if I do this myself.

378
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,853
I do this.

379
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,750
It's all clear.

380
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,048
Wait here.

381
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,205
What kind of man talks to the DEA?

382
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,542
No man.

383
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,878
No man at all.

384
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,462
A crippled little rata.

385
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,924
What a reputation to leave behind.

386
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,523
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

387
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,655
Last chance to look at me, Hector.

388
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,151
Oh, my...

389
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,320
All right, all right.

390
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,865
- Let's get going.
- Oh, Jesus.

391
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,742
Oh, Jesus.

392
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,538
Why don't we start evacuating?

393
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,668
- Start evacuation on the south side.
- Call Security.

394
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,795
Everyone outside right now.

395
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,426
...In the same boat for sure.
But it's that time again...

396
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,804
...where we tell you
about your own hell...

397
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,391
...Albuquerque afternoon commute.
How bad are things out there?

398
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,561
I tell you what, right now southbound
25, got an accident at Jefferson.

399
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,398
Make sure you stay to the left
through that area.

400
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,443
Things have slowed to a crawl
at the Big I, no surprises there either.

401
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:46,115
Hate to interrupt, I have breaking news.
Now, coming out of the North Valley...

402
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,118
...an explosion has been reported
at a nursing home.

403
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,328
- Casa Tranquila nursing home.
- Oh, no.

404
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,581
You heard of that place.
We got few details on it so far.

405
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,628
Unfortunately, initial report is though,
that three people may have been killed.

406
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,755
- Oh, no.
- The news is disturbing.

407
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,967
We're gonna get you information
as soon as it comes in.

408
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:08,804
Situation over there is pretty hectic.
What's traffic looking like?

409
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,223
If you're moving through that area...

410
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:15,060
...we're talking about East and
Westbound Paseo, North Valley.

411
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,813
Please, avoid that area
as you move through.

412
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,401
Our heart's going out to the victims.
We'll bring you details as we get them.

413
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:26,238
Coming up on Coyote 102.5,
Aerosmith, Def Leppard.

414
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,991
Keep it right here
on New Mexico's finest rock...

415
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,154
You wanna cook with a broken arm?

416
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,158
Next step, CO2.

417
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,910
Do it.

418
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,179
Hey.

419
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,431
I better hear them click.

420
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,207
What, you got a problem with stairs?

421
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,207
Gus is dead.

422
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,590
We've got work to do.

423
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,759
He's gonna pull through.

424
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,427
Yeah?

425
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:46,099
Yeah. it looked kind of touch-and-go
there for a while...

426
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,101
...but he's gonna...

427
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,188
He's gonna make it.

428
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:57,027
Oh, thank God.

429
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:08,830
You know,
still saying it wasn't the ricin.

430
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,043
I don't understand.

431
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,045
Then what was it?

432
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:21,093
Saying it was most likely a flower
called lily of the valley.

433
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,762
It's, like, common.

434
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,516
It's got these red berries on it
that I guess taste sweet...

435
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,186
...and sometimes kids eat them
and wind up poisoning themselves.

436
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,398
And that's it, nothing more.

437
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:42,948
So Gus didn't poison him after all.

438
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:53,291
Still he had to go...

439
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,960
...right?

440
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,131
Damn right.

441
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,425
Gus had to go.

442
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,553
Yeah.

443
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,768
You know, I should...

444
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,603
I should get back.

445
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,772
Andrea's waiting.

446
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,197
I'm at Casa Tranquila
where three are dead...

447
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:09,201
...following an explosion
that rocked this facility earlier today.

448
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,204
The fireball completely consumed
one resident's room...

449
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,247
...and damaged common areas
nearby.

450
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,457
Walt?

451
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,918
Let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

452
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,962
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Walt?

453
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,297
How you doing?

454
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,549
How am I doing? How are you doing?

455
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,468
I'm...

456
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,223
I'm doing quite well.

457
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,392
I'm good.

458
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,479
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

459
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,189
Gus Fring is dead.

460
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,235
He was blown up with some person
from some Mexican cartel...

461
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,238
...and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

462
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,366
Do you know about this?

463
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,745
- Walt? I need you to...
- it's over.

464
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,372
We're safe.

465
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,041
...might've heard a rumbling sound...

466
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:02,003
...and another reported a, quote,
"ringing" in the moments just prior.

467
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,422
Administrators
at Casa Tranquila advise...

468
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,177
...that if you do have loved ones
in their care, please do not call in...

469
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,263
Was this you?

470
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,767
What happened?

471
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,062
I won.
