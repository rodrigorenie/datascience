1
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,444
You want me to open the doors?

2
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,991
Here. The keys. Take them.

3
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,369
Why you talking?

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,540
No! No, no, no...

5
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,892
Gambling destroyed my life.

6
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:14,772
Me, my family, everything I loved.

7
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,985
It was like a robbery,
only I was the thief.

8
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,072
It's amazing the stories you tell
yourself to justify it.

9
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,870
The lies that lead you
to just one more hand, one more spin...

10
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,999
...one more roll of the dice.

11
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,837
This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.

12
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,506
You guys are not lifting a finger.
I mean it.

13
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:45,469
Yeah, we're bringing everything. So...
This is not up for debate, okay?

14
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,221
Great.

15
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:51,100
Sweetie, don't worry. We're not
gonna say one word about the bills.

16
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,519
We just wanna bring everyone
up to speed.

17
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,647
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.

18
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,529
So...

19
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,034
Tonight's the night. No turning back.

20
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,037
Well...

21
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,206
Okay. Let's do this.

22
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,669
Okay. So first, I assign point values.

23
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,172
Correlate to the effect of removal.

24
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,759
- You're gonna split the eights?
- Skyler, please.

25
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,513
Now, the mathematical principle
known as the Kelly Criterion...

26
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,891
...upon which I devised
my own strategy...

27
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,101
Not dissimilar to the MIT system...

28
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,645
Walt, you're not teaching them.

29
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,274
- You wanted me to be thorough.
- Play. You're taking too long.

30
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,028
You don't think it behooves me
to be able to explain any of this?

31
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,824
It behooves you to be a pro, that's all.
That's the fiction. So, chop-chop.

32
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,701
Don't chop-chop me.

33
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,622
Now, we both know
that the first decision...

34
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,750
...is whether or not to split
or to surrender.

35
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,127
On eights. Split them.

36
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,214
Good on both.

37
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,217
Next decision is whether
to double down or not.

38
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,637
- Which you should be doing.
- On an 11, yes. Double.

39
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,140
Okay, this hand over here,
we have a soft 18.

40
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,603
The final decision is whether or not
to hit or to stand. Hit it.

41
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,315
- Becomes a hard 15.
- Dealer has a nine.

42
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,109
I see that.

43
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,944
Hit it.

44
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,906
Okay, let's see what I got.

45
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,493
And 21.

46
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,911
- Damn.
- Yup.

47
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,083
Okay, the key thing to remember here
is that it's not about any one hand.

48
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,503
The key is the number of hands
per hour.

49
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,839
Let's go again.

50
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:50,094
Zero, minus one, 0.6.

51
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,513
Okay.

52
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,059
- Walt.
- It's not as if I don't know how to play.

53
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,604
I certainly more than understand
how to count cards.

54
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,106
Let's just keep going.

55
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,192
No, you know what?
I'm in recovery, remember?

56
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,236
I shouldn't even be playing.

57
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,323
And that is the fiction
that we should be sticking to.

58
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,117
You know what?

59
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,414
You're right. Yeah.

60
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:23,669
Okay.
We're not leaving anything to chance.

61
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:28,299
All right. Let's get started.
Got a lot of...

62
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:33,262
- Walt. we got a lot of ground to cover.
- What is this?

63
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,099
We have to get our story straight.
We've gotta be on the same page.

64
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,059
- A script?
- Bullet points.

65
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,188
Bullet points? We got a novella.

66
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,734
This is smart. You really wanna try
to sell a DEA agent some...

67
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,445
...full-of-holes story
about how we suddenly...

68
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,697
...have enough money
to buy a car wash?

69
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,783
- Am I supposed to memorize this?
- We need to practice.

70
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,328
- We need to be word-perfect.
- Within reason.

71
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,330
We need this story to be solid...

72
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,791
...and sympathetic
and, most of all, completely believable.

73
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,085
The story that you already told Marie.

74
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,421
You think that she hasn't told Hank?

75
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,216
Come on, this is Marie
we're talking about here.

76
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,677
No, she hasn't. She hasn't.

77
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,597
Hank thinks his insurance is paying
for everything.

78
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,850
Marie's not telling him
we are paying his therapy bills.

79
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,394
- And neither are we.
- And why is that again?

80
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,732
- Really?
- If we have the gambling story...?

81
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,613
Did you take money, Walt?
You remember Gretchen and Elliot?

82
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,116
I seem to recall that
you'd rather sell drugs than take help.

83
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,078
- Fine.
- Marie will tell Hank in her own time.

84
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,622
And at least we'll have laid
the groundwork.

85
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,750
And coming clean with Hank
and Juni...

86
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,216
Appearing to come clean
will be the best thing for everyone.

87
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,801
We talked about this.

88
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:58,597
- Okay? We agreed about this.
- Yes, we did. it's just...

89
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,891
What?

90
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,644
Never mind. Just...

91
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,942
Okay. So I really think we should
tag team the narrative, okay?

92
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,155
We'll each be responsible for certain
portions of the story and then we can...

93
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,451
We can hand off so we don't leave
anything out, and it'll seem natural.

94
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,621
Okay. So I'm gonna launch
with the exciting news...

95
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,500
...that we are buying a car wash.

96
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,170
The next logical question
Hank will probably ask is:

97
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,757
"Where are you getting the money?"
To which I'll say:

98
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,885
We wanna tell you the whole story.
It's a doozy...

99
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,180
...so hold onto your hats.

100
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,641
Do you like that?

101
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,561
Sure.

102
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:50,149
It accomplishes two things. it keeps
it light while letting them know...

103
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,609
...to expect something big.

104
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,488
Yeah. No. it's a doozy.

105
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:01,160
Okay. Anyway, that's where you will
take over, starting with your diagnosis.

106
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,704
Pages one and two. Okay. And it's...

107
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,916
it's pretty much gonna run parallel
to the truth, which makes it easier.

108
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,128
But just make sure
to really hit the cancer.

109
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,422
Really touch on the fear and despair.

110
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,508
It's good to remind them
and to get their sympathy.

111
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,678
We want them to understand why
you could do something so stupid.

112
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:26,226
Now, after that, per pages three
and four, after you say:

113
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,813
"Gambling became an addiction
and I just couldn't control it."

114
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,440
- Do you see that?
- Yes.

115
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,900
In the middle. Okay.

116
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:37,071
I put in that line about robbery,
from the GA meeting. That was good.

117
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,075
So next, I'll chime in about how
it affected our marriage...

118
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,537
...starting with the confusion, the
deceit, why we couldn't tell anyone...

119
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,957
I'm terribly, terribly ashamed
of my actions.

120
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,418
- Yeah.
- Two "terribly" s?

121
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,047
- It's to show contrition.
- Well, I just wouldn't use that word.

122
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,092
I would never say
the word "terribly."

123
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,054
Phrase it however you want. Okay?
You're jumping ahead. Now...

124
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,557
And why...?
And why am I so ashamed?

125
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,727
Do I really need to answer that?

126
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:14,858
I was, and am,
providing for our family.

127
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,532
- Let's just pick up where we left off.
- I'm weak, I'm out of control.

128
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,283
This makes me look like crap.

129
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,120
This has to be a warts-and-all story.

130
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,914
That's how we'll sell it.
We both look bad.

131
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,874
How do you look bad exactly?

132
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,961
Where is the "I slept with my boss"
bullet point?

133
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,171
I can't seem to find that anywhere.

134
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,675
For a fired schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth...

135
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,386
...I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

136
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,931
I don't like it.
I don't want Junior thinking less of me.

137
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:51,145
At least you won at gambling. I'm the
bitch mom who wouldn't cut you slack.

138
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,028
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,991
I'm sorry
that I put you through all of this.

140
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,496
How's that sound?

141
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,670
Two "sorry" s.

142
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,674
I believe we were on page five.

143
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:26,305
So after you say how very sorry you
are, in your own words, of course...

144
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,973
...we're almost to the end.

145
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:32,352
And then I say how proud I am of you
for joining a 12-step program.

146
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,150
And this is where I think we should
enact how we're feeling, you know?

147
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:45,073
Just a suggestion. You might
look down at the floor with remorse.

148
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,872
What? You don't have to mean it.

149
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,666
You just stare down at your feet,
Walt, okay?

150
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,919
Then I'm gonna...

151
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,382
I was thinking of taking Marie's hand
and saying something emotional like:

152
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,301
it's such a relief to tell you.

153
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,304
We're glad we have a strong family
to help us.

154
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:13,101
That we can all support each other.
And then maybe I'll tear up a little.

155
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,772
I don't know. We'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

156
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,150
You're gonna cry on cue?

157
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,362
- I said, I don't know. Maybe.
- When you dab your eyes...

158
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,406
...you gonna do it
with your right hand or your left?

159
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,785
- One tear? Two tears? How many?
- This has to be convincing.

160
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,080
Especially to Hank.
I'm doing the best I can here, walt.

161
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,998
And yes, I'm thorough.

162
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:41,797
Maybe lying doesn't come
as easily to me as it does to you.

163
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,107
- Guys! Come on in! Hi!
- Hey.

164
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,483
- Good to see you!
- Hey.

165
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,570
- Hey, you little punk! Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,572
- Great to see you.
- How you doing?

167
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,241
Look at my little princess.
She's getting big.

168
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,452
- Yeah. And heavy too.
- Is that actual food I'm smelling?

169
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,705
I might get an
honest-to-God meal here?

170
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,957
- You look good.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

171
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,252
Your Aunt Marie, she's cute,
but she could burn water.

172
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,630
You are so hilarious.
Show the boys your rock collection.

173
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,466
- We're gonna get organized.
- It'll be 20 minutes.

174
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,678
- You have a rock collection?
- It's a mineral collection.

175
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,972
Just something I've...
You wanna see it?

176
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,266
- Sure.
- All right. Let's go see it.

177
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,686
- Oh, hey, let me...
- Hey, no. I... l got it.

178
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,106
Come on, guys. it's down the hall here.

179
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,864
Now, that one there, that's rhodonite.
Okay? it's manganese inosilicate.

180
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,075
Cool. What makes it be
all pink like that?

181
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,371
Well, that's the manganese part. Okay?
It oxidizes, you know, like rust.

182
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,707
Manganese can have
an oxidation state...

183
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,209
...of between minus-three
and plus-seven...

184
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,963
...which takes it through a range
of colors. Purple, green, blue.

185
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,925
But its most stable state is plus-two,
which is usually pale pink.

186
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,429
So...

187
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:20,562
Exactly. Whatever the hell he said.
Anyway, you get the idea.

188
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,401
Yeah, it's interesting.
Interesting stuff, that. Really.

189
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,699
Oh, hey. Yeah, give me that.

190
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,911
Give me that file, will you?
You gotta check this out.

191
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,041
I've been working on something here.
I'm doing a little consulting.

192
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,462
You know, weighing in on a case
for A.P.D.

193
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,175
Put that in for me.
Put that in over there.

194
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,886
Hank, what is this?
It's not a dead body?

195
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,597
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing like that.
No.

196
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,183
Seriously, you guys
you gotta check this out.

197
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,436
This is good. Ready?
Let me get it going here.

198
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,901
Look at this guy.

199
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,028
Look at...

200
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,627
Oh, man.
You can't make this stuff up.

201
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,716
Who is this?

202
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:36,555
That, my friends, is Albuquerque's
public enemy number one.

203
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,773
It's such a relief to finally tell you.

204
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:52,446
We're just so glad that we have
a strong family to help us through this.

205
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,073
That we can all support each other.

206
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:01,872
Jesus. I don't even know where to...
Holy shit.

207
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,790
Yeah.

208
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,419
Walter H. White.

209
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,046
Man of hidden talents.

210
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:16,887
Dad, you're such a stud.
How much did you win exactly?

211
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,850
- Dad?
- I don't think I have exact figures.

212
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:27,189
It's enough to... After taxes, of course,
to buy the car wash.

213
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,692
Maybe even pay for...

214
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,987
...a couple of halfway reasonable
college educations.

215
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,115
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

216
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,246
I can totally get a car
for my birthday now, right?

217
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:53,799
Son, I'm terribly, terribly
ashamed of my actions.

218
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:59,012
Would you excuse me, please?
I need to use the restroom.

219
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,378
Walt?

220
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,681
Hey!

221
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,516
Sorry.

222
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,312
- Thought you might have fallen in.
- No, no, I just...

223
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,899
Hey, man, that was some big stuff
back there.

224
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,070
No, we wanted to be thorough, so...

225
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,242
Yeah, well, it was quite a tale. Couldn't
have been easy to, you know...

226
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,452
...talk about.

227
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,623
You know, Walt, if you...

228
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,503
You can always bend my ear, right?
I mean, if you ever need to talk...

229
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:18,174
...or just blow off some steam,
I'm here.

230
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,678
Not going anywhere, so...

231
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,848
Thanks, Hank.

232
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,773
Same goes for me, you know. if you
ever wanna bounce anything off me...

233
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,735
...I don't know, casework,
anything, really.

234
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,322
Sometimes just talking
something through...

235
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,283
...you know,
really can make a difference.

236
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:49,456
We're definitely not talking bathtub
crank here. This is a big-ass operation.

237
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,334
You know, hundreds of pounds a week.
Maybe more.

238
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:59,633
So who is this person?
What do you know about him?

239
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,427
Other than he's deader
than a Texas salad bar...

240
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,429
...and has a decent set of pipes?

241
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,933
- I'd say he's my guy.
- Your guy?

242
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:15,440
There's this mystery man I've been
chasing for the better part of a year.

243
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:21,029
Cooks the purest meth that me
or anyone else has ever seen.

244
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,991
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

245
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,412
Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?

246
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,667
I looked him up. it was one of these
physic... One of Hitler's guys.

247
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,921
You know, a physicist named
Werner Heisenberg. Real cute, huh?

248
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,967
I figure with a handle like that,
my guy's gotta be some sort of...

249
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,844
Some sort of an egghead. No offense.

250
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,641
And here we go.
Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.

251
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,602
Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm,
you know...

252
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,064
...not barking up the wrong tree,
chemically speaking.

253
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:02,904
As far as I can make out, he's writing
about a phenylacetone cook, right?

254
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,450
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's pretty rare these days...

255
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,829
...but it does jibe
with the blue stuff I've been tracking.

256
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:15,959
"Two sticks dairy-free soy margarine,
two-third cup turbinado sugar."

257
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,966
it's a recipe for vegan s'mores.
There's all kinds of crazy crap in there.

258
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,969
Yeah, like, you know,
top-ten recumbent bicycles...

259
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,762
...indoor composting tips.

260
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,309
All right next to the mother
of methamphetamine syntheses.

261
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,231
This guy was a...
Man, he was a real character.

262
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,609
Yeah, he seems unique.

263
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,446
Yeah. Let me show you something.
Give it here.

264
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,702
Right here at the...
Right here at the top it says:

265
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:57,333
"To W.w.
My star, my perfect silence."

266
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,836
W.W.

267
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,756
I mean, who do you figure that is?

268
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,508
Woodrow Wilson?

269
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,845
Willy Wonka?

270
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,223
Walter White?

271
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,312
You got me.

272
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,358
W.W.

273
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,320
Wait a minute. Let me see this...

274
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,865
...for a second,
because I think I remembered...

275
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,659
Here.

276
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,828
Yes.

277
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,082
Yeah.

278
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,751
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

279
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,336
Learned.

280
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:47,425
And from time to time
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

281
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:51,054
It's a poem by Walt whitman.

282
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,598
Your w.W.

283
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,436
You freaking brainiac.

284
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,399
I must have skipped that day
in school or something.

285
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,611
I been chasing my tail about that one.
Bet you're right.

286
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,781
- Well, I'm glad I could be of help.
- Yeah.

287
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,283
Walt Whitman.

288
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:18,206
So you think this Gale person
is your Heisenberg?

289
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,583
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

290
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,460
God, I wanted to get this guy.

291
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,840
It looks like you did.

292
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,468
No, I mean, you know, me personally,
you know?

293
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,806
I wanted to be the one to slap
the handcuffs on him, that kind of shit.

294
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,685
Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.

295
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:45,400
If I recall, at least from the first
French Connection...

296
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,154
...Popeye Doyle never actually
caught him.

297
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,659
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

298
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,203
Day late and a dollar short.

299
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:07,463
- What about the person who killed him?
- A.P.D.'s problem, not mine.

300
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,382
- Any leads?
- My buddy Tim says...

301
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,302
...they got some fingerprints
they're trying to lD.

302
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,680
Eyewitness saw a person of interest.
Might get lucky there.

303
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,475
Somebody knows something.
They'll track the shooter eventually.

304
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,411
Jesse.

305
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,093
What's up?

306
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,271
I need to talk to you.

307
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,065
Okay.

308
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,279
Now.

309
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,782
Go ahead.

310
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,288
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

311
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,875
I'm not done, yo.
And that dude's next.

312
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,298
- What the hell? what is wrong...?
- We have business to discuss.

313
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,801
So discuss. Jesus.

314
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,386
Let go of me.

315
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,180
Gale's murder is being investigated.

316
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:45,311
And I have it on good authority that
they found fingerprints at the scene.

317
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,397
Not mine.

318
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,818
- We done here?
- No, we are not done here.

319
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,612
What if they are yours?
How can you be so sure?

320
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,533
Because I'm here. Your brother-in-law's
got such a hard-on for me...

321
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,952
...if the cops found my fingerprints...

322
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,580
if the cops found my prints
within five blocks of that place...

323
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,041
...they would've picked me up
by now.

324
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,377
What about the casing?

325
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,587
- Oh, my God.
- Or casings?

326
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,632
How many times
did you shoot him, anyway?

327
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,721
Jesse, did you pick up the casings?

328
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,432
Did you pick them up?

329
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,683
No.

330
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,812
Yeah, well...

331
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:33,192
Listen, we gotta go over this
step-by-step, everything.

332
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,612
Tell me exactly what happened
from the moment you got there.

333
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,948
- I got in, I got out.
- No.

334
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,869
No, I need to know specifics.
Now, we'll start from the beginning.

335
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:47,915
You drove there. You drove over there.
You went to his door, right?

336
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,586
Jesse, I need you to concentrate.

337
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,422
This is very important.
Did you knock or ring?

338
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,050
Knock or ring?

339
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,801
Knock.

340
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,221
Good, good. That's very good.
Now, listen.

341
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,892
Assume that Gale answered the door.
What happened after that?

342
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,435
Did he recognize you?

343
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,771
Did you say anything to each other?

344
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,900
Did you walk into the room or did you
shoot him right then and there?

345
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,401
What?

346
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,907
- Who wants to make a hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

347
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,759
Look, the kid's probably right.

348
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,721
If they had anything on him,
he'd be locked up already.

349
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,516
What about my brother-in-law?
He suspects Jess...

350
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:51,229
Hell, he knows Jesse is involved
in the sale of blue meth.

351
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:56,609
That was Hank's one-and-only lead.
What if he puts two and two together...

352
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,070
...and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

353
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,407
Goes after him how,
on his Rascal scooter?

354
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,161
That perhaps sounded insensitive.

355
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,499
But if he goes after him,
I'll sue his ass for police brutality...

356
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,043
...harassment,
assault and 16 other things.

357
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,755
No, history those two have together,
being what it is...

358
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:22,218
...gotta figure your brother-in-law's
smart enough not to go down that road.

359
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:26,264
Goose egg. Bubkes.
That's what the cops got.

360
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,558
I wouldn't worry about it.

361
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,853
Yeah, what else should I
not worry about, Saul?

362
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,107
Should I not worry that Gus plans to
murder me at the first chance he gets?

363
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,987
That my drug-addicted partner doesn't
seem to care whether he lives or dies?

364
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:46,200
You should see his house.
It's like skid row.

365
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,370
He has actual hobos living there.

366
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,040
Now, how long before Gus decides
that he's too big of a risk?

367
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:58,212
Jeez, I got Mike,
that grunting, dead-eyed cretin...

368
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:02,967
...sucker-punching me in the face.
I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.

369
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,930
I mean, Western Union,
message received.

370
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:15,104
Let me ask you.
When did this stop being a business?

371
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:20,193
Why am I the only person capable
of behaving in a professional manner?

372
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:28,075
No, any way you slice it,
everyone is in danger.

373
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,871
I mean, how can I protect anyone?

374
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,749
My family, Jesse, myself?

375
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,545
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

376
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,801
And meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

377
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:51,224
Oh, yeah.
That ship has sailed, bon voyage.

378
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,310
We are committed.
We already told our family about it.

379
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:57,438
And now Skyler,
I'm sure she believes...

380
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:02,193
She needs to believe
that everything is neat and tidy.

381
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,280
And she's telling herself that
I work in this nice, quiet little lab...

382
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,158
...with a white lab coat
and a pocket protector...

383
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,870
...and when my contract is up,
I'll just simply hang it all up...

384
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,081
...tip my hat and walk away.

385
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,170
Oh, God.

386
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,465
How did everything
get so screwed up?

387
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,971
Yeah, you do have a little
shit-creek action happening.

388
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:42,692
You know, FYl,
you can buy a paddle.

389
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,989
This is a last-resort,
back-pocket kind of thing...

390
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,827
...but if you really gotta protect
yourself, disappear...

391
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:04,255
There's a guy who can make it happen.
They call him a "dissapearer."

392
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,842
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial...

393
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,096
...you and your loved ones can vanish.
Untraceable.

394
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,974
I mean, he sets you up
with a whole new life.

395
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,187
What, like a witness protection
kind of thing?

396
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,690
Beyond. I mean, off the grid.

397
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,361
New identities, new everything.
No one would ever be able to trace you.

398
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,532
Now, be clear. This is an end game,
if you get my meaning.

399
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,118
I mean, there's no coming back.

400
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,375
So you want his card?

401
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,217
God, there's gotta be something else
that I can do.

402
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,764
Some way to keep everything
from spiraling out of control.

403
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,599
Well, from what you told me...

404
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,895
...it sounds like Pinkman is first up
in the imminent-demise department.

405
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,360
Gus won't risk
letting the police find Jesse.

406
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,945
I know him. He won't.

407
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,471
I'm not kidding. if you really
think about it, you can't even see it.

408
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,724
How can you know how bad
radio frequencies, microwaves...

409
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,810
...and cell phones are getting you?

410
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,397
You could be strolling
through security at the airport...

411
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,023
Hey, wake up, bitches.

412
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,943
You get waved through a full-body
x-ray scanner.

413
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:53,447
Next day, you could be dead or dying
from all the radiation they say is safe.

414
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,451
But there's no way it could be.
It has to deliver a concentrated dose.

415
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,161
Enough to penetrate clothes.

416
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:03,207
The accumulated amount could be
dangerous to susceptible individuals...

417
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,584
- ...especially from a rural area.
- Yo.

418
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,838
The ozone layer is already thin
because of the cow farts.

419
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,507
- Yo!
- Oh, hey.

420
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,135
Make sure there's pizza here
when I get back.

421
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,929
- All right? Enough for everybody.
- Oh, yeah.

422
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,849
I can do that. I can definitely do that.

423
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,185
Not a problem.
I can get the stuff, the pizza and stuff.

424
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,480
But as far as the financial situation,
you know...

425
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,156
- Just hang on. Hang on.
- Yeah, yeah.

426
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,200
And you know,
the concentrated doses...

427
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:42,872
...it's gonna fuck with your bone
marrow and it's gonna mess up...

428
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,387
Because... Because especially
if you have cancer.

429
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,932
You know, because if you gotta get
a bone-marrow transplant...

430
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,644
...your odds are 60 percent.
You got a 60 percent chan...

431
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,354
Hey.

432
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,860
Hey, hey.

433
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,904
Get some dipping sticks too, yo.

434
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,948
Yeah, I can definitely get
dipping sticks.

435
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,285
All right. I can get them.

436
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,907
Hey, smoke it up, bitches.

437
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,209
Gotcha!

438
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,415
Wake up.

439
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,712
What's up?

440
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,634
What's up with your ear?

441
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,636
Downstairs. Now.

442
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,061
Where is everybody?

443
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,022
I invited your guests to leave.

444
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,907
Know who this is?

445
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,617
- Nope.
- You ought to.

446
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,079
He's been at your house
for three solid days.

447
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,497
Okay.

448
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,457
He stole your money.

449
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,459
Okay.

450
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:02,339
That $78,000 or so look familiar?

451
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,217
- This is it?
- That's it.

452
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,556
Okay. Thanks.

453
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,813
Wanna know what's next for
Little Miss Pissed-in-His-Pants?

454
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,690
- No.
- You sure, now?

455
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,236
- Yep.
- Don't even wanna take a wild guess?

456
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,407
You're gonna kill him.

457
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,328
Is this the part where
I'm supposed to beg you not to do it?

458
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,998
Oh, please, please.

459
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,000
And then what?

460
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm supposed to promise,
cross my heart...

461
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,423
...to straighten up and fly right
or toe the line...

462
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,092
...or some other crap
that I'm not gonna say?

463
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,471
Is that what your little show here
was all about?

464
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,976
You're on thin ice, you little shithead.
You know that?

465
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,482
You ain't gonna smoke
that dude in there.

466
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,358
You know how come I know?

467
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,613
Because you went through the trouble
of putting a blindfold on him.

468
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,786
I'm going back to bed.

469
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,205
Let yourselves out.

470
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,635
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

471
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,306
- How's the ear?
- Mending.

472
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,190
What can I do for you?

473
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,025
It's Pinkman.

474
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,528
He's become increasingly incautious.

475
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,823
He's a risk. A liability.

476
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,494
I know he and Walter come as a team
and that Walter won't like it...

477
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,539
...but something's gotta be done.

478
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,117
You gotta be kidding.

479
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,461
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

480
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,507
Right.
This is message number three.

481
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:55,137
You'd better be ready in two minutes,
because I am right outside your door.

482
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,684
Jesse.

483
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,813
Jesse!

484
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,903
Damn it.

485
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,035
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

486
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,578
Oh, great.

487
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,958
Jesse!

488
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,835
This is perfect.

489
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,213
You are a piece of work,
you know that?

490
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,727
Jesse?

491
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,981
Jesse.

492
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,153
Jesse?

493
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,808
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

494
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,292
Where is he?

495
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,397
Gonna ask where we're going?

496
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,775
Nope.
