1
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,692
It came out of nowhere.

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,361
You gotta help us.

3
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,533
- Look at all this damn water.
- Don't drink that.

4
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,994
Ain't no telling
if it's gonna be poison.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,729
Nothing new over here.

6
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,422
How's Junior?

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,466
Exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,886
He hasn't said a word
since we told him it was going back.

9
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,640
I spoke to the dealership,
they didn't wanna take it.

10
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,391
What?

11
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,727
It's in perfect condition.

12
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,855
- It's got 17 miles on the odometer.
- I know.

13
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:32,193
I spent an hour sweet-talking
the manager down to a restocking fee.

14
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,403
Eight hundred dollars.

15
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,073
Eight hundred dollars?
For two days?

16
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,660
Well, the law says they don't have
to take it back at all.

17
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:45,039
All right, here's the registration,
the window sticker, the receipt.

18
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,583
Make sure you talk
to the general manager.

19
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,502
His name is Glenn.

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,087
Glenn.

21
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,966
Call me if there's a problem.
And please just don't...

22
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,134
Don't tangle with anyone.

23
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,267
Fine.

24
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,438
Walt.

25
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,388
Shit.

26
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,466
Yes, hello.

27
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
I need a cab.

28
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,430
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

29
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:37,354
I'm at the Pavilion parking lot
on University.

30
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,983
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

31
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,278
Oh, that would be great, thank you.

32
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,073
How long do you think
that would take?

33
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,496
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

34
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,164
Thank you.

35
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,461
Contrition?

36
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,922
Hey, there is total contrition here.

37
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,925
There's mountains of contrition.

38
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,470
"Fan-tan-tastic."
I will messenger them over right away.

39
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh, and about that other thing
unrelated, yes, I can get you in...

40
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,062
...but I gotta warn you,
the eighth hole is murder.

41
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,107
Oh, yeah.
You wanna make it interesting?

42
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,150
Great. Tee time is 7 a.m. sharp.

43
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,402
Prepare to have your ass handed
to you.

44
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,822
Okay. Bye.

45
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,451
He was headed for destruction
of property. Since it's your property...

46
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,747
...I sweated him down
to misdemeanor trash burning.

47
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,251
Now, the only thing is,
it's not gonna be free.

48
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,838
There's a 5 grand fine,
600 for towing and disposal...

49
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,132
...3 grand to steam-clean
the blacktop.

50
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,552
So bottom line, your little joyride is
gonna set you back...

51
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,512
...about 52,000 bucks.

52
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,056
So was it worth it?

53
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,227
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow.
Just tell me it's done.

54
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,479
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

55
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,399
I caught this thing
before it got into the system.

56
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,277
Your record stays clean,
the wife never finds out.

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,489
I've been working magic here.
I could at least get an attaboy.

58
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,244
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.

59
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,177
What is it? Fring?

60
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,263
He will see me dead.

61
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,849
And there's nothing I can do
about it.

62
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,437
All that's left is to wait.

63
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,482
And we're sure about this.

64
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,652
Because Pinkman says
he needs you too much.

65
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Pinkman says.

66
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,127
Unless...

67
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,215
...you could help me find
a third party.

68
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,592
What third party?

69
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,387
Someone who can ameliorate
the situation.

70
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,599
Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?

71
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,851
You talking about a hit man?

72
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,771
Assuming that's still
what they're called.

73
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,522
Wrong answer.

74
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,692
That's what the kids call "epic fail."

75
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,238
All I would need is a phone number.
I'd do the rest.

76
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,074
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.

77
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,492
A big one.

78
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,246
If you held my feet to the fire,
I could come up with names.

79
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,332
One or two guys west of the Rockies
who do this work.

80
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,417
But guess what. These guys?

81
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,295
They know Mike
and Mike knows them.

82
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,965
Mike knows everyone who does this?

83
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,133
Who do you think gave me
their names?

84
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,054
All right. Okay, plan B.
Look, we go outside my network.

85
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,723
Craigslist. Soldier of Fortune.

86
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,977
Let's say we get lucky.
I mean, incredibly lucky...

87
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,145
...and find a guy who's not a cop...

88
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,399
...or some kind
of survivalist nut-job wannabe.

89
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,819
You gotta ask yourself:
How good is good enough?

90
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,948
Whatever goombah we buy
is gonna come head-to-head with Mike.

91
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,491
And Gus Fring?

92
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey, just winging that guy is
not gonna "ameliorate" your situation.

93
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,039
Not by a damn sight.

94
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,543
I've tried to solve this,
but I can't get anywhere near him.

95
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,961
You can't get near him?

96
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,422
Why don't you ask your partner?

97
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,012
Yeah, I saw him.

98
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,598
And you tell Saul before you tell me?

99
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,435
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

100
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,646
Every time I go over there,
Saul hassles me about Mike.

101
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,816
He's still scared
the dude's gonna come break his legs.

102
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,694
So I give him the latest.

103
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,821
What happened exactly?

104
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:02,995
I was at a diner with Mike
and he just shows up.

105
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,664
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

106
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,416
That's it.

107
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,712
So this is, like, a regular thing?

108
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,549
How close were you to him?

109
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,925
Close.

110
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,429
I mean, closer than you and me
right now.

111
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,308
Did he speak to you?

112
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,315
It was over in 10 seconds.

113
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,400
Would you just answer?

114
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,945
He said, he sees things in people.

115
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,366
What things?

116
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,950
What people?

117
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,202
Me.

118
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,747
He said, he sees something in me.

119
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:56,131
A month ago,
Gus was trying to kill both of us.

120
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:01,595
And now he pulls you out of the lab
and employs you as what?

121
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,472
An assistant gunman?

122
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,474
A tough guy?

123
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,602
Does that make any sense to you?

124
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,399
He says, he sees something in you.

125
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,361
What kind of game is he playing?

126
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,114
Does he think you're that naive?

127
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,619
He can't truly think
that you'd forget...

128
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,833
Well, let alone Gale,
let alone Victor...

129
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,169
...and all the horror
that goes along with all of that.

130
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,839
What about this girlfriend of yours...

131
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,174
...and her little brother?

132
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,428
I mean, the man looked you straight
in the eye...

133
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,725
...and told you, "No more children."
But that very night, that little boy...

134
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,227
...he just...

135
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,312
He winds up...

136
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,900
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

137
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,280
- Okay.
- All I'm just saying is that...

138
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,993
...is it possible that he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

139
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,079
Drop the sales pitch.

140
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,081
I'll do it.

141
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,126
You'll do what?

142
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,963
I'll kill him.

143
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,924
First chance I get.

144
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,990
Piña colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

145
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,244
Does anyone want their car to smell
like the bottom of a 6th-grader's desk?

146
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,954
Okay. Hemp? Really?

147
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,708
I know. But you know what they say.
"The customer's always right."

148
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,712
Speaking of customer, it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

149
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,050
I was thinking huge party, balloons,
bouncy house for the kids...

150
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,260
...you know, make a splash,
get on TV.

151
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,348
Let people know they won't face the
eyebrows of doom when they come in.

152
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,894
Marie, how's Hank doing?

153
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,396
You know what? He's doing better.

154
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,441
- Really?
- Yeah. He...

155
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:25,781
Lately, his mood's improved
and he's like a maniac with his PT.

156
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,990
That's fantastic.

157
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:31,161
Yeah, don't get me wrong,
he's got a long way to go, but he...

158
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,121
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey.

159
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,834
- Hey. Hi, Walt. it's good to see you.
- Hey. You too.

160
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,380
Hey, your cashier here
is quite the salesperson.

161
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,259
She just talked me into something
called the Orbital Paste wax Buff.

162
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,595
Oh, yeah, it's very important
to maintain your clear coat.

163
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,264
Boy, once that's goes...

164
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,848
Oh, yeah.

165
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,144
Hi.

166
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,069
Bogdan was averaging 19 cars
during rush hour...

167
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,990
...and we are already up to 22.
Twenty-two actual cars.

168
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:13,245
Last night, I deposited $3800.

169
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,373
Jesus.

170
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,041
How much is that?

171
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,421
Two hundred seventy-four
thousand dollars, give or take.

172
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,674
- Give or take?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,176
I haven't counted it.

174
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,012
Wait.

175
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,806
Two hundred and seventy-four...

176
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,850
And this is how often?

177
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,768
Every two weeks.

178
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,814
Thursday's good for a drop-off?

179
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,649
But, walt...

180
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:49,281
...are you telling me
you make $7,125,000 a year?

181
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,870
Seven and a half even,
before expenses.

182
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,913
But I can't...

183
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,083
- This is too much.
- So it's more...

184
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,461
...than you thought...

185
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,380
...and this is somehow bad news?

186
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,883
No, that's not the point.

187
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,595
I mean, there's no car wash
in the world...

188
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,847
...that could do
this kind of business.

189
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,226
I mean, this is nine months work here,
minimum.

190
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,021
Seven million?
That could take years.

191
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,191
So set some aside.
Save it for a rainy day.

192
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,110
Save it? Where? Save it where?

193
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,698
I can't go to the bank with it.
I sure can't leave it here.

194
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,536
Wait a minute.

195
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,205
Is this all 50s?

196
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,584
- Who pays for a car wash with a 50?
- Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

197
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,962
I was under the impression
that you had this under control.

198
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,132
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

199
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,554
- The 50s are gonna be a problem.
- That's what this is, problem solving.

200
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,973
This is a simple division of labor.

201
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,310
I bring money. You launder money.
This is what you wanted.

202
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,854
I never wanted any of this.

203
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,898
I've gotta go.

204
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,818
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

205
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,956
Okay, then.

206
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,742
You're telling me
you made this in the lab?

207
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,786
Why not?

208
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,248
Making it in his own lab
seemed appropriate.

209
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,042
There's not much of it.

210
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,211
We had more for Tuco.

211
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,046
It's enough.

212
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,048
This is still the best way.

213
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,593
You go after him with a gun,
you'll never get out of it alive.

214
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,345
But with this?

215
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,764
You slip it into his food or drink.

216
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,225
There shouldn't be
any taste or smell.

217
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,061
Thirty-six hours later...

218
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,525
A man his age,
working as hard as he does...

219
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,194
...no one will be surprised.

220
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,115
What about Mike?

221
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,744
Mike can have his suspicions,
but that's all they'll be.

222
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,541
Please, one homicidal maniac
at a time.

223
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,261
I don't know
when I'm gonna see Gus again.

224
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,514
I mean, if ever.

225
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,476
Keep it with you.

226
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,563
When you have the opportunity...

227
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,523
...be ready.

228
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,152
What if they search me?

229
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,574
Will they do that?

230
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,836
It's the wrong way around.

231
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,840
It's my lucky cigarette.

232
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,261
Well...

233
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,473
...whatever you do, don't smoke it.

234
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,351
You know they have a drive-thru,
right?

235
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,269
No, this is good.

236
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,023
Could use the exercise,
get the blood pumping.

237
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,943
Don't worry,
you're not gonna have to pick me up.

238
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,072
Might take me a while,
but I'll get there.

239
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,368
Jesus, ain't we a pair.

240
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,537
Hey, you must really like chicken.

241
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:37,212
V-8, 470 horses, 20-inch rims,
satellite radio, Bluetooth.

242
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,757
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

243
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,259
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean,
on a lark?

244
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,889
Spur of the moment, your dad ups
and buys you a brand-new Challenger?

245
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,101
Yeah, I barely got it
around the block...

246
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,772
...and Mom said we couldn't afford it
so they took it back.

247
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,484
Do you know how long I had it?
Fifteen hours.

248
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,570
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

249
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,156
When I was your age...

250
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,786
...I'd have given my left nut
to drive a car like that for 15 minutes.

251
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,330
Seriously, how does that happen?

252
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,668
Well, we were looking at used cars
and I kind of...

253
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,212
You guilted him into it. I know.
I hear you.

254
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,091
You pulled the old, "Poor little me
and my troubles," am I right?

255
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,386
- Maybe.
- You flew too close to the sun.

256
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,597
You'd let him buy you a clunker,
you'd be driving now...

257
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,225
...instead
of borrowing mom's hooptie.

258
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,435
Agent Schrader.

259
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,521
- How are you doing?
- Well, thank you. Good to see you.

260
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,565
Do you remember Mr. Fring?

261
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,359
- How are you?
- Well. Nice to see you again.

262
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,362
It's a pleasure to see you.
You're looking well.

263
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,743
Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up
to clean living and vitamin pills.

264
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,620
I must apologize.
If I had seen you come in...

265
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,081
...there'd have been no question
of accepting your money.

266
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,417
In the future, feel free to ask for me.

267
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,629
A DEA hero should never have to pay
for a meal at Polios Hermanos.

268
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,550
No kidding?
Well, I'll take you up on that, for sure.

269
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,594
And how are your mother
and father?

270
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,179
They're good.

271
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,389
- The chicken is great.
- Thank you.

272
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,601
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work...

273
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,645
...perhaps something after school?
My door is open.

274
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,355
Sounds good.

275
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,818
I don't know about this one.
He might eat up all your profits.

276
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,739
I'll let you finish your meal.
Can I get you anything else?

277
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,909
- A refill, perhaps?
- No, thank you. I'm good.

278
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,996
- Sure. Take a Diet Coke, thank you.
- Of course.

279
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,490
So where are we going?

280
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:15,161
Oh, big doings today.

281
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:21,042
The order of the day is eyes open,
mouth shut.

282
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,628
What's up?

283
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,598
Test.

284
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,141
You got me?

285
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,018
Count off.

286
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,363
Let's go.

287
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,869
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

288
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,373
You know how to make coffee?

289
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,875
Sure.

290
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,877
There you go.

291
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,590
- You want a rundown?
- Please.

292
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,427
Three guys up at the gate,
two visible, one in the blind.

293
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,514
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

294
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,976
I got Tyrus down in the tree line
with a Barrett .50.

295
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:06,356
Planted him there last night,
in case we had any early arrivals.

296
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,174
I don't have an extra holster.

297
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,927
Stick this in your pocket.
Keep it out of sight.

298
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,807
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

299
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,354
It's loaded?

300
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:53,278
I don't wanna see that in your hand
unless you see me with mine.

301
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
Emergency only.

302
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,908
First car is coming.

303
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,290
All right,
what's the order of the day?

304
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,834
Eyes open, mouth shut.

305
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,108
A lot of guns.

306
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,236
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

307
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,576
You wanna sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

308
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,204
I am the guy.

309
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,584
All right, then.

310
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,215
Welcome.

311
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,510
Where is the rest of your party?

312
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,805
I am the only one coming.

313
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,848
And why is that?

314
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,937
My employers feel I can adequately
represent their interests.

315
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,484
Please, sit.

316
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,126
This is my offer.

317
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:18,214
In consideration
of our previous relationship...

318
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,679
...I will make a one-time payment...

319
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:29,225
...of 50 million U.S. dollars.

320
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,774
In return our business is concluded.

321
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,362
No further payments.
No further contact.

322
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:44,407
An absolute severance.

323
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,586
You have no response?

324
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,466
This is my response:

325
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,551
Yes or no?

326
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,180
You know what the Cartel wants.

327
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,225
Anything else would be a waste of time.

328
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,731
Is it to be yes... or no?

329
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,486
A hard way to begin a negotiation.

330
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,407
This is not a negotiation.

331
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,176
You got something of mine?

332
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,811
Glove box.

333
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,234
Figure I better teach you
how to shoot.

334
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,444
Could be things are gonna get hairy.

335
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,324
What is this?

336
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,036
I mean, you're giving me a gun...

337
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,999
...and now I'm, like, part of the team
or whatever?

338
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,296
He said he sees something in me.

339
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,673
Like what?

340
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,471
If I had to put it in a word...

341
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:17,101
...I'd guess loyalty.

342
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,145
Loyalty.

343
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,485
Only maybe you got it
for the wrong guy.

344
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,172
Jesse?

345
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,883
- Hey.
- Hey.

346
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,010
Long time, no see.

347
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,348
How you doing?

348
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,308
Yeah, you know...

349
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,603
- ...good.
- Good.

350
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,605
Good.

351
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,693
Okay, we're gonna get started.
You coming in?

352
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,909
So the truth is, we can't change
the past, what's done is done.

353
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,537
We've gotta own our actions,
but putting ourselves on trial...

354
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,667
...acting as our own judge, jury
and executioner, it's not the answer.

355
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,169
A lot of the time,
all that judging does...

356
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,757
...is just ensure
that we're gonna repeat the cycle.

357
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,717
Right?

358
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,095
"I'm such an asshole.

359
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,099
It's totally hopeless,
what's the point?

360
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,142
I think I'll have a hit."

361
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,603
Jesse...

362
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,065
...what's going on with you
these days?

363
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,405
I went back to the crystal.

364
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,699
You sober now?

365
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,367
Yeah.

366
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,202
Four days.

367
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,453
Big whoop, right?

368
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,414
Hey, four days is four days.

369
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,998
You're here.

370
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,584
You still...

371
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,629
...working at the laundry?

372
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,964
How are things there?

373
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,551
Sucks ass.

374
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,263
Anything you wanna talk about?

375
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,734
A couple of weeks back...

376
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,530
...I killed a dog.

377
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,785
You hit it with your car?

378
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,331
No.

379
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,585
I put him down.

380
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,504
I watched him go.

381
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,883
I was looking him straight in the eye.

382
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,764
He didn't know what was happening.
He didn't know why. He...

383
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,143
He was just scared.

384
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,189
And then he was gone.

385
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,900
He was suffering.

386
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,818
It was a kindness.

387
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,697
No, he wasn't sick.

388
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,452
No. He was just, like...

389
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,830
I don't know, like, a...

390
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,875
...problem dog.

391
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,877
What did he do?

392
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,086
Bite someone?

393
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,300
No, this dog never...

394
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,011
Never bit anybody.

395
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,891
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

396
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,184
Anything can happen.

397
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,686
It ain't no rock that made me do it.

398
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,314
What was the problem?
Why did you kill him?

399
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,733
Watch the crosstalk, please.

400
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,947
Maybe it's not the details that matter,
right?

401
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,866
How do you feel about what you did,
Jesse?

402
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,913
I don't know.

403
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,251
Who cares how you feel?

404
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,212
What kind of person kills a dog
for no reason?

405
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,463
Colleen.

406
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,341
Put an ad in the paper,
drop him off at a shelter.

407
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,679
You don't just sit there and talk about
killing a helpless, innocent animal.

408
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,765
We're not here to sit in judgment.

409
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,434
Why not?

410
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,355
Why not? Maybe she's right.

411
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:36,068
Maybe I should have put it in the paper.
I should've done something different.

412
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:43,534
The thing is, if you just do stuff
and nothing happens...

413
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,288
...what's it all mean?

414
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,164
What's the point?

415
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,504
Oh, right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

416
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,966
Kicking yourself
doesn't give meaning to anything.

417
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,304
So I should stop judging...

418
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,390
- ...and accept?
- It's a start.

419
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,226
So no matter what I do...

420
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,770
...hooray for me
because I'm a great guy?

421
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,023
It's all good?

422
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:20,779
No matter how many dogs I kill, I just,
what, do an inventory and accept?

423
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:28,621
I mean, you back your truck over
your own kid and you, like, accept?

424
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,957
- What a load of crap?
- Hey, Jesse.

425
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,334
I know you're in pain.

426
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,586
No, you know what?

427
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,049
Why I'm here in the first place?

428
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,595
Is to sell you meth.

429
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,309
You're nothing to me but customers!

430
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,273
I made you my bitch.

431
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,859
You okay with that?

432
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,529
You accept?

433
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,658
No.

434
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,628
About time.

435
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,202
Jesse.

436
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,913
Bring a light over here, will you?

437
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,594
Do you see any residue there?

438
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:13,600
- Where?
- Here. On the bottom, right there.

439
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,939
It's been a week. what's going on?

440
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,859
I haven't seen him.

441
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,489
I didn't think so. But I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

442
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,599
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy. Look at that.

443
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,394
Graduated to doorman.
Finally found your calling.

444
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,480
Oh, little whiskers, Marie.

445
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,689
What did you do?

446
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:05,110
Show your barber a picture
of a dog's ass and said, "I'll take that"?

447
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,528
Charming as usual.

448
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,905
Welcome back.

449
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,324
- Looking good, Marie.
- Thanks, Steve.

450
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,661
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- He's fine. We can take it from here.

451
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,830
- Yeah.
- If you wanna hold his elbow.

452
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:21,085
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me.
I'm good. I'm good.

453
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,380
Hey.

454
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,383
Good luck.

455
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,808
Let's go, we're running late.
Come on.

456
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:45,275
Hank, seeing you walk in here, I can't
tell you what that means to all of us.

457
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,612
Your progress, it's incredible.

458
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,116
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

459
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,911
- Steve tell you his news?
- What?

460
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,163
Finally got your period?

461
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,207
I made GS-14.

462
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,084
Wow, that's all right, man.

463
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,129
Next stop: Washington, D.C.
Sitting behind a desk...

464
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,756
...papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

465
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,758
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

466
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,969
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.

467
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,554
Thanks.

468
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,056
Steve said you might have something
for us.

469
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,226
Yeah, maybe.
You guys are gonna have to tell me.

470
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,437
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

471
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,897
APD detective?

472
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,316
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case.

473
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,944
The victim's a 34-year-old
male Caucasian...

474
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,238
...by the name of Gale Boetticher.

475
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,700
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door...

476
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:39,329
...takes a bullet to the face
from a person or persons unknown.

477
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,417
Now, this Gale Boetticher
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

478
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,628
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

479
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:51,091
And, well, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

480
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,136
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

481
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:59,558
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number-one meth cook.

482
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:04,855
And what caught my eye
is his specialty product is blue.

483
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,107
So, what are you thinking?

484
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,650
This is your Heisenberg?

485
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,573
No. What I think we got here
is Heisenberg's former cook...

486
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,327
...and maybe a line
on Heisenberg himself.

487
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,042
Anyway, lo and behold,
amidst all the hippie-dippy nonsense...

488
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,085
...I find this.

489
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,298
Now, this here,
I do a little Google-fu...

490
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:36,094
...and I realize it's a parts number
specifically for this baby.

491
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:43,644
That there is a high-volume
HEPA industrial air filtration system.

492
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,687
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.

493
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:50,150
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant
or microchip factory...

494
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:55,405
...or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

495
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,992
Okay.

496
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,662
So this little dingus here
is manufactured...

497
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,959
...by a big international concern:
Madrigal Electromotive.

498
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:11,755
I call their Houston office, I get through
to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.

499
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:16,009
I use the Schrader sweet-talk.
Before you know it, she's pulling files.

500
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:21,598
Six months ago, one of these systems
was shipped to a depot here in ABQ.

501
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,809
Who signed for it?

502
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,352
Gale Boetticher.

503
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,441
So I asked my new girlfriend, "Who
paid for it?" And she says, "Nobody."

504
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,571
They have no record that anybody
actually paid for this thing.

505
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,200
So I go back and push more
and before you know it...

506
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,452
...the temp's gone,
there's no address.

507
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,623
I'm talking to some snot-nose lawyer
who's asking me for my badge number.

508
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,667
Brick wall.

509
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,630
So I take a peek
into Madrigal Electromotive.

510
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,383
Now, Madrigal
is based in Hanover, Germany...

511
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,303
...but they're
what they call "highly diversified."

512
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,265
industrial equipment, global shipping,
major construction...

513
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:07,728
...and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food...

514
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,314
...specifically a local chain.

515
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,524
Polios Hermanos.

516
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,196
Okay. So what, right?
Boetticher's dead.

517
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,366
I got no line
on who's been bankrolling him...

518
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,452
...or where his lab was.

519
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,912
The whole thing's a snipe hunt,
right?

520
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,167
But now I get this crazy idea...

521
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,669
...and I can't shake it.

522
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,131
I mean, I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling...

523
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,633
...trying to make sense of it.
That napkin.

524
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,469
I told you Boetticher's vegan.

525
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,014
We're talking this guy
makes his own fermented lentil bread...

526
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,391
...or whatever the hell that is.

527
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:52,022
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

528
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,235
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

529
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,154
Like who?

530
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,823
Well, like, maybe...

531
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,494
...this guy.

532
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,876
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring, huh?

533
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,420
This whole
friend-of-law-enforcement thing?

534
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,757
Could be a case of, "keep your
friends close but your enemies closer."

535
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,009
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

536
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,930
Maybe he's got the connections too.
Maybe, just maybe...

537
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,765
...he's our guy.

538
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,731
Hank, no offense,
but I think you're really reaching.

539
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,193
If your guy had his meeting at KFC...

540
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,406
...you wouldn't immediately assume
he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.

541
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,282
You know, I...

542
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,077
I couldn't agree more, guys.

543
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:52,040
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know.

544
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:57,087
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.

545
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,507
I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat,
you know?

546
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,802
Except...

547
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,849
...I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing...

548
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:13,979
...and that is,
what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints...

549
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,607
...doing
in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
