1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,348
More.

2
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,399
Another.

3
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,986
Careful, señor.

4
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,531
Hot day like today...

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,866
...too much oil in the machine...

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,577
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,624
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,459
Those who drink...

9
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,545
...and those who pour.

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,714
Shut up and fill my glass.

11
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,143
Hey, you two.

12
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,770
Yes, you.

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,523
I used to be just like you.

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,068
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

15
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,945
But no more.

16
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,575
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,827
...by waiting in line for the tap.

18
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,579
Listen to him.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,498
He can teach you something!

20
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,171
Hey, how you doing, boss?

21
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,343
Good to see you, my friend.

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,723
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

23
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,017
I keep thinking I should write a book.

24
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,269
Maybe, maybe...

25
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,526
So, what brings you to this
burro's asshole of a town?

26
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,987
I knew I would find you here.

27
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,950
Don't you have something to deliver?

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
Cutting it close, aren't you?

29
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,873
Lots of time.

30
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:08,378
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

31
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,838
Finishes first.

32
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,299
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

33
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,802
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

34
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,721
Yeah?

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,390
You've got such a way with words.

36
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,770
They flow like a waterfall.

37
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,647
I like that about you.

38
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:36,865
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

39
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,992
No, I feel terrible.

40
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,704
So bad I came all the way here
to this burro's asshole...

41
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,498
...to give you your present.

42
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,749
Present?

43
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,836
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

44
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,255
Forget it, I wanted to.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,341
I have it for you in the back.

46
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,263
- Back there?
- Yes. Come. Follow me.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,362
It's perfect!

48
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,281
Do you really like it?

49
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,243
I love it!

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,620
What a great pet it will make.

51
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,163
Thank you, boss!

52
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,748
Excellent.

53
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,376
Let me sign it for you.

54
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,086
Let me sign it...

55
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:38,302
..."For the big talker."

56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,447
He's still breathing.

57
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,159
Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

58
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,164
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

59
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,376
Mum's the word.

60
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,459
Son of a bitch.

61
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,684
Hang on, baby.

62
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,864
<i>Hello.</i>

63
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,991
Walt? Are you in the house?

64
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

65
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,918
What? What the hell
are you doing in there?

66
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,628
I'm back.

67
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,422
No, no, you're not back, Walt.

68
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,342
You're not back.
Get... Get out of there.

69
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,761
- Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
- No...

70
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,847
I'm staying. End of story.

71
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,434
- We had an agreement.
- I didn't agree to anything.

72
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,771
Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

73
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,857
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

74
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:43,487
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

75
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,116
Well, suit yourself.

76
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,993
Walt.

77
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,662
Walt?

78
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,856
What is wrong with you?

79
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,443
- Skyler, I have... every right to be here.
- No, you don't.

80
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,905
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

81
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,783
- I don't agree to a divorce.
- Well, it's not up to you.

82
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:36,164
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police...

83
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,960
...and I'm going to tell them
everything.

84
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,838
I mean it, Walt.

85
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,926
There's the phone.

86
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,113
It's ringing.

87
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,328
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>

88
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,748
<i>Operator number 314.</i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

89
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,920
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

90
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:27,758
Yes, I want to report a disturbance,
please.

91
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,804
No, no, it's not...
It's not exactly, it's...

92
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,683
It's a domestic issue.

93
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,810
Okay.

94
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,982
They're connecting me.

95
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,529
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

96
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,240
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

97
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,786
This family is everything to me.

98
00:08:56,078 --> 00:09:00,666
- Without it, I have nothing to lose.
- Fine.

99
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,963
Yes. My name is Skyler White.

100
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,132
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

101
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:14,972
My soon-to-be... ex-husband
broke into my house...

102
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,767
...and I need an officer to come
and remove him.

103
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,772
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

104
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,986
Okay. Okay.

105
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,823
Thank you.

106
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,247
They're coming.

107
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,423
- Dad's here?
- Great, he's home.

108
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,759
- Dad.
- Hey, son.

109
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,677
How are you?

110
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,889
Are you back for good?

111
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:43,685
- Why are you home so soon?
- I'm not.

112
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,814
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

113
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,274
- Sure.
- You want one too?

114
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,611
Walter, your dad and I
have something we need to discuss.

115
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,281
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

116
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:01,620
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

117
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,330
- Walter?
- How was school?

118
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,290
- It was good.
- Yeah? Homework?

119
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,710
- No, not really.
- Not really? What does that mean?

120
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,889
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

121
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,308
Yeah, that's the plan.

122
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,908
Hello, ma'am.
We were called about a disturbance?

123
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:44,288
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

124
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,915
Yeah, that was me.

125
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,545
You called the cops on Dad?

126
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,510
I came home from work
and he was back.

127
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,013
He had just moved back
into the house.

128
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:07,436
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. I just...

129
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,523
I want him out.
I want him out of the house.

130
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,152
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

131
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,196
It's very important
you answer honestly.

132
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,324
- Did he strike you?
- No.

133
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:24,661
- Has he... ever hit you?
- No. This is not about violence.

134
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,997
This is about trespassing.

135
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:31,960
- About him being here against my will.
- Okay. Trespassing.

136
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,756
- You're divorced, then?
- No, working on it.

137
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,593
- Right now, were separated.
- Legally separated?

138
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,221
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

139
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,266
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

140
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:50,020
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

141
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,064
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

142
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,567
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

143
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,320
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

144
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,989
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

145
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,075
Unless he's threatened you
or the kids.

146
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:09,206
No. Not physically.
But having him in the house is just...

147
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:14,294
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

148
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:20,926
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

149
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,722
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

150
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,308
That was it.

151
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,021
- I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
- Disagreements.

152
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,859
Yes, well, we've had our share of that.

153
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,406
I haven't... I haven't been
the most attentive husband lately.

154
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:49,371
Mrs. White, would this be... easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

155
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:59,047
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

156
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,757
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

157
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,635
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

158
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,389
Is it possible maybe
he's broken any laws that you know of?

159
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:11,810
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

160
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,521
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

161
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,940
I'll get him out of the house for you.

162
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,151
What's your take on all this?

163
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,154
It's my mom's fault.

164
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:29,953
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

165
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,623
I don't know why
she's being this way.

166
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:38,086
My dad, he is a great guy.

167
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,007
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

168
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,259
Mrs. White.

169
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,765
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis...

170
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,726
...for us to remove your husband
from the house.

171
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,855
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control...

172
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,567
...you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

173
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,028
I'd really look into
some counselling.

174
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,240
Best of luck to you folks.

175
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,117
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

176
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,711
Why you gotta...?
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

177
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,924
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

178
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,930
Sorry.

179
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,199
Welcome home.

180
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,288
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

181
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,832
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

182
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,878
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

183
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:46,381
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

184
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:52,095
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

185
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,975
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits...

186
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,394
...since I didn't hear from you,
you know.

187
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,981
You realise how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

188
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,816
What if I was trying to warn you...

189
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,445
...that the DEA was gonna kick down
your door? What then?

190
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,698
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

191
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,992
Fair enough.
Remember the other day...

192
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:18,163
...when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

193
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,791
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

194
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,544
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

195
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,546
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

196
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,424
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

197
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,636
So, what do you say?

198
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,098
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

199
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,725
I mean, you gonna call him?

200
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:43,063
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

201
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,107
Final thought.

202
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:50,070
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

203
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,491
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

204
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,077
Call him.

205
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,002
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

206
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,253
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

207
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,006
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

208
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,322
Schrader.

209
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,824
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

210
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,495
Yeah?

211
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,751
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

212
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,380
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

213
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,382
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...

214
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,885
...I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

215
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,392
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

216
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,855
Merkert called in a couple of favours.
El Paso wants me back.

217
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,191
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

218
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,818
Thank you.

219
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,572
Hello.

220
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,081
Gentlemen. Welcome.

221
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,417
Thank you for coming.

222
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,961
Any difficulty at the border?

223
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,464
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

224
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,342
Please, come in.

225
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:26,263
I apologise that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

226
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,234
My apologies, Gustavo.

227
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,696
Of course,
you should have been advised.

228
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,991
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

229
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,451
But...

230
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,580
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

231
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,249
Indeed, he is.

232
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,669
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

233
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,506
I don't know him by that name, but yes.

234
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,674
I've made no secret of the fact that...

235
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:07,179
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

236
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:12,059
You and I,
we still make money together.

237
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:17,314
It's never affected our relationship.

238
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,818
Don Salamanca had a
nephew named Tuco.

239
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,446
Yes, I knew of him.

240
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,742
Then perhaps you know Don Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

241
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,037
Thought of Tuco as a son.

242
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:37,459
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

243
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,838
He was a key man in our
organisation north of the border.

244
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,173
He was loyal.

245
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,009
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

246
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,762
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.

247
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,056
Until he betrayed Tuco.

248
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:56,436
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

249
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,356
Tuco's cousins here...

250
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,233
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

251
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,027
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

252
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,114
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

253
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,159
Don Salamanca.

254
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,328
Gentlemen.

255
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,831
I feel your loss deeply.

256
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,585
Please accept my condolences.

257
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:26,049
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

258
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:32,014
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

259
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,392
When our business is done...

260
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:40,439
...he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

261
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,193
Until then...

262
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,448
...I need him alive.

263
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,206
Excuse us.

264
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,265
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

265
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,977
You should really leave matters
of my organisation's politics to me.

266
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:22,564
Do I not run my own territory?

267
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,149
Of course you do.

268
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,360
And I will advise them to be patient.

269
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,863
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

270
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,866
Or you risk losing the
good graces of the cartel.

271
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,160
That would not be wise.

272
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:40,749
And those boys inside...

273
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,544
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

274
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,172
They are not like you and I.

275
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,117
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

276
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,326
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

277
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,954
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

278
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,719
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

279
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:34,928
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

280
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,806
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

281
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,145
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you...</i>

282
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:28,190
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,736
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

284
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:38,200
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

285
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:43,956
I've got you. Yes. Yes.

286
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,669
Skyler? Want some help?

287
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,975
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

288
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,698
God...

289
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,760
- What do you mean? Against your will?
- Yes.

290
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:42,681
Very much against my will.
He just... He showed right back up.

291
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,977
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

292
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,106
I called the police on him.

293
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,650
I was so clo...

294
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:58,197
- So close to what?
- Nothing. Never mind.

295
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:03,785
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

296
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,331
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege...

297
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,666
...to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

298
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,128
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorise me to.

299
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,923
Even if it's something illegal?

300
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,800
Especially if it's illegal.

301
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:23,555
I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

302
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,651
My husband makes meth.

303
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,780
Methamphetamine.

304
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,786
- Your husband's a drug dealer?
- A manufacturer, technically.

305
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:50,958
They... They call them cooks.

306
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,460
I looked it up on the Internet.

307
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:57,506
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

308
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,425
Sue your husband for divorce
immediately.

309
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:04,179
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

310
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,808
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

311
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,603
If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

312
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,481
No questions asked.
This is a no-brainer.

313
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,776
It's the best thing for you
and your family.

314
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,905
I can't.

315
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,617
I can't do it.

316
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:32,624
I don't want my son to find out
that his father is a criminal.

317
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,294
I just...

318
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:41,008
- I can't do that to him.
- In the... end, it may not be up to you.

319
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,052
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

320
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,224
Walt has lung cancer.

321
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,977
His treatment bought him some time.

322
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:55,314
But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later...

323
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:02,029
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family...

324
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:04,364
...when things may...

325
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:10,454
...resolve themselves on their own...

326
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:15,042
...without anyone... else knowing.

327
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,509
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

328
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,846
- What are we doing in this shithole?
- Relax, will you?

329
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,349
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

330
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,977
- We should have went to Chili's, man.
- All right, already. Jesus.

331
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:38,565
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

332
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,151
What's wrong with spicing things
up a little?

333
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,364
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

334
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,784
So when you headed back down
to El Paso?

335
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,163
You know. Between all the packing,
errands, getting the ducks in a row...

336
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,792
...maybe a week or two.
- Week or two?

337
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,461
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

338
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,880
It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

339
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,382
What are you talking about?

340
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,636
Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

341
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,264
I'm gonna hit the head.

342
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:46,341
Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

343
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,555
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

344
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:58,061
- All right.
- What you doing?

345
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,938
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?

346
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,357
Since when can't we handle
a couple dirtballs?

347
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:03,942
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

348
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,778
What if Vice is running
some kind of undercover op?

349
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,994
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

350
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,864
- Where you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

351
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,575
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

352
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,380
Stand up.

353
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:17,641
You got a problem with us, bitch?

354
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,810
Your move.

355
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,673
DEA. Don't move.

356
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:59,016
Go out and tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

357
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:37,054
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

358
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:38,263
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

359
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,807
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

360
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,531
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

361
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,366
<i>"Do Not Call..."</i>

362
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,507
<i>The number you have reached,</i>
<i>149-4985...</i>

363
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:17,469
<i>...in area code 505 is no longer...</i>

364
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:58,612
Skyler.

365
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,075
Can we talk?

366
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,717
ASAC wants to see you.

367
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:24,096
And?

368
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,682
We were hanging back,
saw a deal go down.

369
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,600
I went outside to call it in.

370
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,769
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

371
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,146
That's when they attacked you.

372
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,406
What I didn't tell him is that
you left your gun under the seat...

373
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,284
...before you went back inside.

374
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:06,180
I've done a terrible thing.
But I did it for a good reason.

375
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:10,142
I did it for us.

376
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:18,025
That is college tuition
for Walter Jr...

377
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:22,404
...and Holly 18 years
down the road.

378
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:28,702
That is health insurance
for you and the kids.

379
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:35,667
For Junior's physical therapy,
his SAT tutor.

380
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,546
It's money for groceries...

381
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,591
...for gas...

382
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:47,763
...for birthdays
and graduation parties.

383
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,937
Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head...

384
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,606
...the mortgage you aren't
gonna be able to afford...

385
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,526
...on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

386
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:04,571
- Walt, I...
- Please. Please.

387
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:14,498
This money, I didn't steal it.

388
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,584
It doesn't belong to anyone... else.

389
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,837
I earned it.

390
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:26,009
The things I've done to earn it...

391
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:37,729
...the things that I've had to do...

392
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:43,068
...I've got to live with them.

393
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,742
Skyler...

394
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,039
...all that I've done...

395
00:40:56,248 --> 00:41:01,670
...all the sacrifices that I have
made for this family...

396
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:07,801
...all of it will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've... earned.

397
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,804
Please.

398
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:17,811
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

399
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,399
You can give me your answer then.

400
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,340
Hey, Sky.

401
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,236
- Hey, some coffee?
- Yeah.

402
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:53,657
That report's looking real good.
I like how it looks.

403
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,367
Good.

404
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,794
Are your kids home?

405
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:49,630
<i>It's here! It's here!</i>
<i>Everybody, come on in! Look!</i>

406
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:53,675
Hey, Mrs. White.

407
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:56,678
Hey, Louis.

408
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:59,932
Hey, thanks for having me
over for dinner.

409
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:02,309
Sure.

410
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:08,023
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.

411
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:13,028
Pot roast. Could you...?

412
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:35,342
So how was your day?

413
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,763
- Good.
- Good.

414
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,973
Excellent.

415
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:46,603
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis
to stay for dinner tonight.

416
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:51,191
You know, as a thank-you for driving
Walter Jr. To school for us.

417
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,319
We've been kind of absent...

418
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:59,241
...but, I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

419
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:10,294
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good
about our talk this morning...

420
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,922
...and I'm very eager
to hear what you're thinking about...

421
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,008
...about what we talked about.

422
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,927
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

423
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:30,439
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

424
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:55,255
I fucked Ted.

425
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:06,350
Boys, dinner.

426
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:10,062
- Iced tea?
- Yeah.

427
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,605
- Okay.
- Thank you.

428
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,190
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

429
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:14,900
All right.

430
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:19,821
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

431
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,117
- Okay.
- I know nobody likes salad...

432
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:26,036
...but it's good for you.

433
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:28,205
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
