1
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,665
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?

2
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,459
Oh, okay.

3
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,712
Down means off.

4
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,926
You know why I pulled you over
this morning?

5
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,220
Well, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't speeding.

6
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,680
I've been using the cruise control,
so I don't...

7
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,432
No, sir, your windshield.

8
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,728
License and registration, please.

9
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,773
Right.

10
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,822
This... This was from Wayfarer 515.

11
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,910
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.

12
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,623
And that's what shattered
my windshield...

13
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,334
...some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

14
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,670
I understand.

15
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:57,135
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

16
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,721
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

17
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,307
I was one of the first responders
on the scene.

18
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,978
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.

19
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,231
What? What, you don't believe me?

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,692
Regardless of how that windshield
was damaged...

21
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,988
...this car is unsafe to drive in
this condition. Stay in the car, please.

22
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,910
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

23
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,247
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.

24
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,165
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

25
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,126
It's time for you to listen to me.

26
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,004
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?

27
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,007
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights. You understand that?

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,968
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

29
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,387
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

30
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,681
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?

31
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,184
I told you that my house
was in the debris field.

32
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,103
Do you have the remotest inkling
of what that means?

33
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,148
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house...

34
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,649
...where my children sleep!

35
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,903
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,030
- Are you kidding me?!
- Sir, last warning.

37
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,157
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?

38
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,827
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.

39
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:08,207
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing
his opinion under the First Amendment!

40
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,735
Lastly a little something from
down El Paso way.

41
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:42,199
Border Patrol came across multiple
homicides just this side of the border.

42
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,453
Truck turns out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez into Laredo.

43
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,789
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek...

44
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,749
...with these <i>polleros</i> for two years.

45
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,169
But this time, soon as they made it
across, someone hit them.

46
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,754
Hit them hard.

47
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,424
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.

48
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,927
So this truck was carrying more
than just people.

49
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,137
What are we looking at,
weed, coke or meth?

50
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,140
No, doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

51
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,184
Why'd the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

52
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,311
They didn't. I pulled it.

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,357
You ask me, this is high-end
cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.

54
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,735
Question is, why do we have
Juarez-style action...

55
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,821
...on our side of the DMZ?

56
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,365
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?

57
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,369
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

58
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:31,415
Maybe one of those... extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

59
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,792
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

60
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,961
All right, that's it. Slow news day.

61
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,130
Add one more to the countdown.

62
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,965
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?

63
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,467
We're waiting on that famous
blue meth of yours.

64
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,345
Twenty-nine days since
we saw it last.

65
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,348
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.

66
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,684
Local P.D. I gotta take this.

67
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,477
Gomey, go beat your piñata.

68
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,731
Rest of you jokers,
too damn quiet in here.

69
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,941
Catch some bad guys.

70
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,902
Schrader.

71
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,112
Hey, what's up, Walt?

72
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,865
What?

73
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,499
Jesse?

74
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,961
Hey, Dad.

75
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,924
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

76
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:09,721
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.

77
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,767
You doing okay?

78
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,270
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

79
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,774
I just happened to be driving by
and saw the sign.

80
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,819
So you're selling the place.

81
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,865
In this market. Can you believe it?

82
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,785
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

83
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,580
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

84
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,915
We did all new stucco,
all new master suite...

85
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,252
...sandblasted,
fumigated the basement.

86
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,006
Right on.

87
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,508
Yeah.

88
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,262
You know, fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

89
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,558
I read that in, I wanna say,
like <i>TIME</i> magazine.

90
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,313
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

91
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,316
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens...

92
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,737
...granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.

93
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,450
Damn. That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?

94
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,914
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.

95
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,544
There are pictures on the website,
if you want to take a look.

96
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,799
Cool.

97
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,010
You're looking healthy.

98
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,971
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.

99
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,018
Thanks.

100
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:44,024
You know, I could come by sometime
for dinner or something.

101
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,111
Yeah. Sometime.

102
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,283
Okay.

103
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,410
Later, Dad.

104
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:12,386
You know, look,
he's a high-school teacher.

105
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,264
He's never been in trouble
a day in his life.

106
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,349
He finds out he's got lung cancer...

107
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,395
...and now his wife kicks
the poor bastard out of his own house.

108
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:27,985
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates
a little slack, here's the guy.

109
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:41,248
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?

110
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:51,341
Officer, I'm very sorry that
I lost my temper.

111
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:57,181
There's no excuse for my behaviour.
It was disrespectful.

112
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,188
Yeah. Thanks, man.

113
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,542
She's divorcing me.

114
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,340
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

115
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,384
It is what it is.

116
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,932
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

117
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,103
She said that?

118
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,981
Yeah.

119
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,714
You don't write, you don't call.

120
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,221
God.

121
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,641
It's a disaster.

122
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.

123
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,814
It's not a disaster, all right?

124
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,234
She's not going to the cops,
she's not gonna tell a living soul.

125
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:38,240
You wanna know why?
One word: Blowback.

126
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:43,620
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster,
for her.

127
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:49,042
That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed.
You were right under his nose.

128
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:53,005
He'll be lucky if they let him
bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.

129
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,674
The kids? Paging Dr. Phil.

130
00:11:55,883 --> 00:12:00,137
My daddy's a drug dealer
and my mommy turned him in.

131
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,850
And the house? Gone. Feds would RICO
her and the kids out on the street.

132
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,396
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No. It's not gonna happen.

133
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:14,443
She's bluffing and she knows it.

134
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,536
Her going to the police
is not the point, Saul.

135
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,789
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

136
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:32,878
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.

137
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,257
Hey, buddy.

138
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,720
- It's bad. It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.

139
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,098
But we live to fight another day.

140
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:49,394
And after a decent interval of time...

141
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,689
...well, there are other fish
in the sea.

142
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,693
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

143
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,863
You'll be just amazed at
what's out there.

144
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,491
Thailand, the Czech Republic.

145
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:08,038
I mean, those women are so grateful
to even be here.

146
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,293
In the meantime,
idle hands are the devil's plaything.

147
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:18,632
So why don't you get back on the horse
and do what you do best?

148
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,886
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.

149
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,021
I can't be the bad guy.

150
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,149
What?

151
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,445
I can't be the bad guy.

152
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,077
Okay.

153
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,708
You know, we'll revisit.

154
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:59,631
Just promise me
you won't hang yourself in the closet.

155
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,290
Pop-pop!

156
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,044
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!

157
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,305
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.

158
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:00,192
- Yeah.
- <i>It's me. We may have a wife problem.</i>

159
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,028
<i>Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

160
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,240
You got an address?

161
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,720
Hey. Dinner's gonna be late.

162
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,516
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout...

163
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,436
...but if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

164
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,634
Hey, buddy,
pass the ketchup, will you?

165
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:22,191
What? I've had enough trans-fat
for one lifetime.

166
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,193
Two-day drive
from the nearest ocean...

167
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,904
...and you're... eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.

168
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,909
Been awhile since that minnow's
been swimming. Right, buddy?

169
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,038
Yeah.

170
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,958
You know, Flynn here is looking
for a part-time job...

171
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,212
...so, I don't know, if you know of
anything you might want to...

172
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,631
My name's Walter Jr.

173
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,968
Like, what,
you can't even say his name?

174
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,305
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn...

175
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,226
...all you need to do is just tell me
that you don't want to be called Flynn.

176
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,770
Dad didn't even show up
till fourth period.

177
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,940
And his eyes were all red,
like he's been crying or something.

178
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,193
But you, you don't even care!

179
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,738
And now he won't even
drive me home.

180
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:14,284
He won't say why, but I know
it's because you told him not to.

181
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,745
- Honey, I...
- What?

182
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,456
I don't know what your problem is.

183
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:24,586
You may not love him anymore,
but I do.

184
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:29,591
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?!

185
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,510
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Oh, God.

186
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,013
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's...

187
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,724
It's all right.

188
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,395
Hey, hey.

189
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:47,276
Skyler, I know that you must have
your reasons for all of this.

190
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,822
Sky, the...

191
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:56,159
I know it's none of my business...

192
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,123
...but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...

193
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,173
You're right, Hank.

194
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,177
It's none of your business.

195
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,060
Oh, my God. After all of that?

196
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,855
Please, tell me
that you are still not curious.

197
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,774
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.

198
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,777
The day I heard the words
"second cell phone". I knew.

199
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:34,281
- Believe me. Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay. All right.

200
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,284
So, what? Stop dancing around it.

201
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,162
What is it exactly that you have seen
a hundred times?

202
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,872
Please, pleasee... enlighten me.

203
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,668
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.

204
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,380
But, let's face it, underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

205
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,717
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.

206
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,678
He acts up. He steps out.

207
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,933
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

208
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:05,479
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.

209
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:10,943
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

210
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,278
I... I don't know.

211
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:18,033
I think if he cheated on her,
that she would have told me by now.

212
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:23,372
It just feels like something more.

213
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,716
Yes, yes, yes, 24<i>l</i>7 coverage.
Need you ask?

214
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,468
How much is this gonna run me?

215
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,639
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.

216
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,267
Yeah, I'll call you.

217
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,144
Return of the prodigal,
back to the land of the living.

218
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,855
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

219
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,650
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

220
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:56,363
Unencumbered young man
with stacks of cash.

221
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:01,994
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

222
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,874
Speaking of cash, you know
what's giving me heartburn lately?

223
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:11,086
Your former partner. This guy,
he works like a bastard, right?

224
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,880
Builds a business single-handed.

225
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:17,384
Finally the big money shows up
and what does he do? He walks out.

226
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,723
Talent like that and he flushes
it down the crapper.

227
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,143
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

228
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,771
Look, I know you're out of it
and all...

229
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,232
...but you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

230
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,276
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

231
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,987
All right, all right, scratch that.

232
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:40,324
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you.

233
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,243
All due respect.

234
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,289
You want a job?

235
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,499
A job?

236
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,587
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.

237
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,042
There you go.

238
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

239
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,967
Thought I'd...

240
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,595
...well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.

241
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,556
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.

242
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,893
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

243
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,895
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.

244
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:44,109
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.

245
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,612
She's a beauty. Look at her.

246
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,991
Hey, thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

247
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:56,246
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.

248
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,212
Listen, believe me, this is...

249
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,007
I don't want to bring this up,
but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

250
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,344
I'm sorry, I just can't.

251
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,182
Is that right?

252
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:22,523
If you're gonna do this,
it can't be so glaring.

253
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,276
Glaring.

254
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,445
Okay.

255
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,743
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.

256
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,293
Keller.

257
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,675
Again. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

258
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,469
Revenue with no backup.

259
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:57,558
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.

260
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,150
Yeah.

261
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,947
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?

262
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:16,577
How about if I just push 28,800...

263
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:22,291
...out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?

264
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:33,135
I'm just saying I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

265
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,220
Fair enough.

266
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,264
I'll take care of it.

267
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,516
Thank you for the heads-up.

268
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,728
You won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.

269
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,940
What if your kids found out?

270
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:55,616
- Lf my kids found out?
- This. What you're doing.

271
00:26:55,824 --> 00:27:00,329
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?

272
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:07,169
Well, put me on the spot,
why don't you?

273
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,131
I guess maybe I'd...

274
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:15,260
I'd say that I might have feet of clay...

275
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,888
...but that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

276
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:21,642
You know, trying to provide.

277
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,563
And I'd ask them to try
to take the time to understand...

278
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:32,528
You know what? Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

279
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,864
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water, so...

280
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,034
I'd better get back to it.

281
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,920
Oh, God.

282
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,465
Hi, Walt.

283
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:57,302
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...

284
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,971
What?

285
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,057
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

286
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,308
No, no, no, of course.

287
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,019
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.

288
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:09,857
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.

289
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,235
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

290
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,905
I mean, I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now.

291
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,408
But wouldn't it be... easier if we...?

292
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:23,954
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

293
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,123
Okay, bye.

294
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,584
Why are you doing this?

295
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:34,006
She's just trying to keep me from
seeing you and you're helping her.

296
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:40,721
Well, son, I mean, your mother,
she has her reasons.

297
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,890
What reasons?

298
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,102
They're...

299
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,063
Well, they're...

300
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,943
Well, they're just a little difficult
to delineate.

301
00:28:55,152 --> 00:29:01,325
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides
to every story, always.

302
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,786
But she...

303
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,373
Yeah.

304
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:15,047
This is just how it has to be
for now, okay?

305
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:20,010
Now, look, your home is your home
and that is where you belong, all right?

306
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:24,473
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

307
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,433
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...

308
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,521
...everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

309
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:34,441
Everybody is on your side.

310
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:43,116
Well, it's not about taking sides,
though.

311
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,995
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.

312
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:51,500
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?

313
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,879
No matter what, all of this has nothing
to do with how we feel about you, okay?

314
00:29:56,088 --> 00:30:00,050
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

315
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:04,346
You and your sister will
come first always.

316
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,975
Come on.

317
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:16,316
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay? Both of us.

318
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,695
Let's just buck up.

319
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,240
And I'll take you home.

320
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,957
Let me first just
hit the old bathroom here.

321
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,852
Hello. Good afternoon.

322
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,479
- Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.

323
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,317
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

324
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,694
Better call Saul!

325
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:03,822
I get it all the time.

326
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:08,493
We're here to discuss the sale of
the property at 9809 Margo.

327
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:12,080
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?

328
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,000
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

329
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:18,795
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

330
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,506
However, for our purposes...

331
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:24,051
...you might just as well visualise
a large bag of money.

332
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:28,514
This individual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

333
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,475
- Cash?
- Cash. I know, in this economy.

334
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,478
The money is already burning a hole
in my client's account.

335
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,981
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

336
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,692
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

337
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,988
Fair enough. We get a few papers
signed and notarised...

338
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,990
...we can take care of this right now.

339
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,035
In fact, I could wire you your money
this very afternoon.

340
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:53,830
There's just one little hair
in the soup.

341
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,041
The price.

342
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:02,798
We feel 875 is very fair.

343
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,260
But I suppose there's always
a little wiggle room.

344
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:12,516
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

345
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,478
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?

346
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,689
No, that's my offer.

347
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,108
That's less than half-price.

348
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,360
We put that much
into the renovations alone.

349
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,320
Why don't we just cut
the clown act...

350
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,574
...and you tell us what you're willing
to come up to?

351
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,451
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.

352
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:32,911
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.

353
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,539
How could you possibly imagine
we'd entertain this?

354
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,082
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.

355
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,586
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab.

356
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,296
That used to be in the basement.

357
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,549
I looked over your signed disclosure
statements...

358
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,177
...and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab. Nope.

359
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,638
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.

360
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:53,223
But no meth lab.

361
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:58,937
Now, some would call that fraud
in service of concealing a felony.

362
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:04,484
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.

363
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,945
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.

364
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,822
I mean, good try...

365
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,326
...at sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past a buyer.

366
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:16,121
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

367
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,752
Now, I could file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely.

368
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,171
Or I could start some criminal
proceedings.

369
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,466
But I don't think any of us want that,
now, do we?

370
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:31,136
How about it, counsellor?
Do you concur?

371
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,034
There you go, son.

372
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,830
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

373
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,421
Okay.

374
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,976
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

375
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:27,776
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

376
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:33,532
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.

377
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:37,953
Hi, honey.

378
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,584
Sorry.

379
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,173
Skyler.

380
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:55,262
I mean, what kind of example do
we want to set here, right?

381
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,683
I mean, can't we at least just sit down
and eat a piece of pizza together?

382
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,728
Just hash things out like adults?

383
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:08,567
We have discussed everything
we need to discuss.

384
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,653
I thought I made myself very clear.

385
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:17,576
I got dipping sticks.

386
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,743
<i>You've reached Walt's</i>
<i>temporary number.</i>

387
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,745
<i>Please, leave a message.</i>

388
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,002
<i>When I went out this morning</i>
<i>to get the newspaper...</i>

389
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,213
<i>...I saw a pizza on our roof.</i>

390
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:56,091
<i>Would you know anything about that?</i>

391
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:59,511
<i>Listen to me, Walt.</i>
<i>You need to control yourself.</i>

392
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,474
<i>Calm down, accept the situation</i>
<i>and k eep your distance.</i>

393
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:09,354
<i>If you can't manage that,</i>
<i>I will get a restraining order.</i>

394
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,656
Skyler. Skyler.

395
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:24,786
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!

396
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,553
Breaking even is not so bad.

397
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,806
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

398
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:50,854
Poor Jake. He had his heart set
on going to Space Camp.

399
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,107
Oh, no.

400
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:57,945
Oh, God. This is all we need.

401
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:03,242
Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?

402
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:07,496
Jesse, it's really not a good time.

403
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:09,164
Come on.

404
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:12,292
Jesse, the house has been sold.

405
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,461
The new owners are... expected
at any moment.

406
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:17,130
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

407
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,051
I bought the place.

408
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:37,276
Be back by seven, okay?

409
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,278
Love you.

410
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,577
Bye.

411
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,436
No!

412
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,189
Oh, God.

413
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:56,887
It's me. There's something
he should know about.

414
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,641
Hold on.
