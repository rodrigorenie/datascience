1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>KDK-12, come in.</i>

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,428
<i>- KDK-12.</i>
- KDK-12.

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>Hey, Bobby,</i>
<i>need you to look in on Mrs. Peyk etewa.</i>

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,143
- She all right?
<i>- Her daughter called from California.</i>

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,480
<i>She hasn't heard from her in a while,</i>
<i>kind of worried.</i>

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,357
Will do.

7
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,412
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

8
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,375
Miss Peyketewa.

9
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,052
Miss Peyketewa.

10
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,115
KDK-12 here.
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

11
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,242
<i>- Come again?</i>
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

12
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,579
- I need some backup out here.
<i>- Okay. On their way.</i>

13
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:32,004
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now!

14
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,807
Hold it right there.

15
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,309
Let me see your hands.

16
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,518
Hands!

17
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,064
All right, down.

18
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,566
On your knees.

19
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,651
You understand me?

20
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,196
Do you speak English?

21
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,284
I said, down. On your knees.

22
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,036
Down!

23
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,624
Damn it, get down.

24
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,042
On your knees.

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,502
Do it.

26
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,006
On your knees or I'll fire!

27
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,802
- Yeah?
<i>- I found the papers.</i>

28
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,264
<i>Right where you left them,</i>
<i>in the crib.</i>

29
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,349
Yeah, well...

30
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,894
You know best, right?

31
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,855
Anything else?

32
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,648
Do you have any thought...

33
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:20,445
...about how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr?

34
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,322
<i>Well, he's still my son.</i>

35
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,533
<i>- I mean, he will remain...</i>
- Of course.

36
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,911
<i>My point being...</i>

37
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,372
...the divorce.

38
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,960
<i>Well, I...</i>

39
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,088
I think he gets it, don't you?

40
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,216
I mean, I...

41
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,802
I think he saw it coming.

42
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,096
He sees your unhappiness and...

43
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,098
<i>My unhappiness?</i>

44
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,393
<i>My completely out-of-the-clear...</i>

45
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,689
...blue-sky unhappiness?

46
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,524
<i>Really?</i>

47
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,819
Look, as you said, for the best.

48
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,362
Yeah.

49
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,198
Okay.

50
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,826
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

51
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:13,040
<i>In the child support worksheet,</i>
<i>you list medical, dental...</i>

52
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:19,421
...child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

53
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,089
That's right, all of it.

54
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,676
Walt.

55
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,223
- No.
<i>- Skyler, you wanted me out...</i>

56
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,226
...I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

57
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,478
<i>Not with that money.</i>

58
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,731
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

59
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,610
How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

60
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,574
I have to go.

61
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,826
Yep, I was right.

62
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,496
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

63
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,541
I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others.

64
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,376
No, no, this one's fine.

65
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,670
I'll take it.

66
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,134
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so...

67
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,845
Yeah, I like it.

68
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,847
I like... everything about it.

69
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,975
I'll take it as-is.

70
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,565
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

71
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,366
- You have to clean the fryer.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,621
We try to clean them every night...

73
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,667
...but make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

74
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:43,046
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

75
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,716
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...

76
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,928
...clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

77
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,930
Main valve on, main switch on.

78
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,475
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

79
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,655
You're for real?

80
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,283
- This is all you?
- All me.

81
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,619
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

82
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,787
My man Jesse can cook.

83
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,707
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

84
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,210
- Just the right shade of blue.
- Good shade.

85
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,379
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger...

86
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,591
...it would be a Jolly Rancher.
- Be my guest.

87
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,721
You sure?

88
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,141
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

89
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,770
No. I can watch, yo.

90
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,190
- I can cook and I can watch.
- Go for it.

91
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,526
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

92
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,945
Go easy.

93
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,614
Okay.

94
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,383
<i>Riverdance.</i>

95
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,594
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

96
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,725
Bow before me.

97
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,646
I am Lord of the Dance.

98
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,148
Shit.

99
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,775
I gotta try that again.

100
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,861
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

101
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,613
That is awesome, Jesse.

102
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:37,035
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...

103
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,288
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

104
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,623
Like anthrax.

105
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,126
Good.

106
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,086
So...

107
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,422
...you ready to talk some business?

108
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,594
You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

109
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,264
I know...

110
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,391
...what you're thinking.

111
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,811
Trust me,
it's not gonna be like it was.

112
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,606
All right, never gonna be like it was.

113
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,150
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

114
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,569
All right? We sell it smart.

115
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,989
We don't get greedy, like before.

116
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,658
I don't know, man.

117
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,660
Combo and all.

118
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,545
Still...

119
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,173
...man's gotta make his living.

120
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:36,261
If it's like Jesse says
and we're not greedy...

121
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,055
I mean...

122
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,098
...I guess I can see it.

123
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,435
Had a good thing going
before we started pushing our luck.

124
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,980
- Lf it can go back to being like that...
- Hey, it will be.

125
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,608
Step one, we build inventory.

126
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,235
Badger, go see Clovis.

127
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,864
Get the RV in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

128
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,785
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights. Not us.

129
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,036
Cautious.

130
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,329
- Right on.
- You got it.

131
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:07,042
You know that buzzer thing?
Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

132
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,254
Just have him put in
one of those too.

133
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,756
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

134
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,967
I'll get you a list.

135
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,635
Right on.

136
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,595
Yeah?

137
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,098
- Yeah.
- All right.

138
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,685
So...

139
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,478
...we good?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,688
Good?

141
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,232
- All right.
- Let's do this thing.

142
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,457
Brandon Mayhew.

143
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,668
I know you.

144
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,797
Small world, Albuquerque.

145
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,778
Wanna talk about it?

146
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,240
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

147
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,993
You know, ironically...

148
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:09,414
...I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

149
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,624
Sure.

150
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,377
Well, just as much of me at least.

151
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,421
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

152
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,049
What, I don't get a vote in this
either?

153
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:23,220
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

154
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,808
I do feel guilty.

155
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,607
I am the man that I am, son...

156
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,112
...and there's plenty
that I would change about that, but...

157
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,369
Here we are,
and this is just what it is.

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,668
You know what? Call me crazy...

159
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:59,548
...but I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

160
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,626
Morning.

161
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,294
They're back.

162
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,925
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

163
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,551
Why?

164
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,887
They're doing nothing wrong.

165
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,020
Okay, let's put this on Table 33,
okay?

166
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,231
Hello there.

167
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,401
Mr. White, I presume?

168
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,612
Oh, yes. Hi.

169
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,197
L...

170
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,491
Sorry. I'll be right down.

171
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,004
- Hi. Gale Boetticher.
- Hi.

172
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,717
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

173
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:49,927
Yes, I am.

174
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,596
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

175
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,349
I have my résumé here for you.

176
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,395
I received my bachelor's degree
from UNM.

177
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,273
My master's
from the University of Colorado.

178
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,860
Organic chemistry
with a speciality in...

179
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,779
It's all right there.

180
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,199
"X-ray crystallography."

181
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,408
Really?

182
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,288
I could talk about that for hours.

183
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,790
I would love to.

184
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,544
But first, I'm curious about this.

185
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,550
That's a little pet project of mine.

186
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:34,680
See, in my opinion,
it's all about the quinic acid level.

187
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,767
You want just north of 4800 milligrams
per litre...

188
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,521
...but if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

189
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,898
Bitterness, yuck.

190
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,442
So I pull a mild vacuum.

191
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:52,906
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C and...

192
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,080
Judge for yourself.

193
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,970
Oh, my God.

194
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,315
My God, that is the best coffee
I've... ever tasted.

195
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,860
Sumatran beans...

196
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,280
...and I also have to give credit
to the grind...

197
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,158
...but thank you, Mr. White.
- Walt.

198
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,410
Please, call me Walt.

199
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,955
Why the hell are we making meth?

200
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,026
Hey.

201
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,778
Tell me...

202
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,489
...with the phenylacetic acid
solution...

203
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:02,244
...you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes...

204
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:06,123
...and then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

205
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:11,170
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl...

206
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,923
...you get an oilier aqueous layer,
and hence...

207
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,800
Better benzene... extraction.

208
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,636
Exactly.

209
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,181
But actually, I prefer ether.

210
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,141
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

211
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,902
Gale, I'm wondering how you...

212
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,945
Ended up here.

213
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:43,493
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

214
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:48,665
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike... each other as criminals.

215
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:54,838
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime...

216
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,007
...I suppose.

217
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,009
I'm definitely a libertarian.

218
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,054
Consenting adults want
what they want...

219
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,724
...and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere... else.

220
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,644
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

221
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:12,606
No added toxins or adulterants.

222
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,611
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to...

223
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,698
...pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

224
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,576
I was on my way,
jumping through hoops...

225
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,620
...kissing the proper behinds...

226
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:32,209
...attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

227
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,836
You know that world.

228
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,923
That is not what I signed on for.

229
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:44,054
I love the lab.

230
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,641
Because it's all still magic.

231
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,851
You know?

232
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,688
Chemistry?

233
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,399
I mean...

234
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,734
...once you lose that...

235
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,069
It is.

236
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,738
It is magic.

237
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,074
It still is.

238
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,955
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

239
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,042
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

240
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,545
I don't know it.

241
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,088
Anyway...

242
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,549
Well, can you recite it?

243
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,138
Pathetically enough, I could.

244
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,432
All right, well...

245
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,018
No, no, come on. Come on.

246
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,311
Yeah?

247
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,152
<i>When I heard the learn'd astronomer</i>

248
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:46,033
<i>When the proofs, the figures</i>
<i>Were ranged in columns before me</i>

249
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,952
<i>When I was shown the charts</i>
<i>And the diagrams</i>

250
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,830
<i>To add, divide, and measure them</i>

251
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,166
<i>When I, sitting,</i>
<i>Heard the astronomer</i>

252
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:59,213
<i>Where he lectured with much applause</i>
<i>In the lecture-room</i>

253
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:05,135
<i>How soon, unaccountable</i>
<i>I became tired and sick</i>

254
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,554
<i>Till rising and gliding out</i>

255
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,806
<i>I wander'd off by myself</i>

256
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,769
<i>In the mystical moist night-air</i>

257
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,687
<i>And from time to time</i>

258
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:20,484
<i>Look'd up in perfect silence</i>
<i>At the stars</i>

259
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,951
Yes.

260
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,827
I am a nerd.

261
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,542
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

262
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:40,963
Come on, Pinkman.

263
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,215
You little rat bastard.

264
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,677
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

265
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,090
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Are you ever coming home?</i>

266
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,592
Marie, I'm working.

267
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,510
Did you find it? The RV?

268
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,429
<i>No. Working on it, so...</i>

269
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,726
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

270
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,770
<i>It's not simple.</i>
<i>There's a thing called the Constitution.</i>

271
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,107
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

272
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,614
<i>This kid, I swear to God,</i>
<i>I wish I just could...</i>

273
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,909
This is that Pinkman character?

274
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,202
<i>That's the one.</i>

275
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,621
<i>Positive the little bastard's</i>
<i>got an RV.</i>

276
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,998
I just don't know where he keeps it.

277
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:01,793
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something...

278
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,797
...I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

279
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,718
Well, not to bring up
ancient history...

280
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:14,806
...but I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

281
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,059
Possibly.

282
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,644
It's worth a shot.

283
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,562
Yeah?

284
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,565
Who?

285
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,279
- Hello.
<i>- Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

286
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,656
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

287
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,533
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

288
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,660
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.</i>

289
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,746
<i>- I just had a quick question.</i>
- Shoot.

290
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:42,084
I only ask this because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentially.

291
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,628
I'm working a case and...

292
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:51,051
You know that I would never put you on
the spot or make you uncomfortable.

293
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,929
Hank, you could just cut
to the chase.

294
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:58,767
Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down...

295
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,019
<i>...through your student,</i>
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

296
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:05,065
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time...

297
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,526
...he may have dealt you
a little weed.

298
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,986
- Hank...
<i>- Just a little.</i>

299
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,738
<i>And I so do not care about that.</i>

300
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,157
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

301
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,951
<i>Lik e you said, cut to the chase.</i>

302
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,540
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?</i>

303
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,753
<i>You know, a recreational vehicle...</i>

304
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:31,425
...you know, like a Winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

305
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,345
Why?

306
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:39,433
<i>Long story, but I'm personally of</i>
<i>the opinion he's moved on from weed...</i>

307
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:45,480
<i>...and graduated to selling</i>
<i>crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.</i>

308
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,112
Walt?

309
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,255
Yo.

310
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,845
What, Mr. White?

311
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,239
<i>How's my fav ourite genius?</i>

312
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,115
Is this a secure line?

313
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,993
<i>Is this a secure...?</i>
<i>Yes, what's with the...?</i>

314
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:41,495
Hey, hello to you too.

315
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,206
Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

316
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,124
- I'm listening.
<i>- My brother-in-law...</i>

317
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,252
<i>...he knows about the RV.</i>

318
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,461
What RV?

319
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,838
Our RV...

320
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:55,300
...the one which contains a meth lab,
which is covered with my fingerprints.

321
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:59,096
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

322
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,015
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

323
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:06,270
<i>He has link ed it to Jesse. It's a matter</i>
<i>of time before he tracks it down.</i>

324
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,064
<i>So get rid of it!</i>
<i>What are you doing sitting there?</i>

325
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,818
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

326
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,863
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

327
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:19,366
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

328
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:22,870
Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

329
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,206
And do what exactly?

330
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,958
I mean, what...?

331
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:32,337
The thing is the size of a...

332
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:33,839
It's RV-size.

333
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,592
<i>I mean, where do I go</i>
<i>to mak e an RV disappear?</i>

334
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,218
I'm not David Copperfield.

335
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,096
What do I look like,
the RV disposal people?

336
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,640
- Did you not plan for this contingency?
- No.

337
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,101
Well, next time, plan for it,
would you?

338
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,021
The <i>Starship Enterprise</i>
had a self-destruct button.

339
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,315
Okay. Shut up.

340
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,484
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

341
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:59,948
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

342
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:03,202
You did that,
you would be rolling in it.

343
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,662
Socket wrench.

344
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,623
The big one.

345
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,753
What? You scared of the Arabs?

346
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,053
You out of your minds?
Why is this in the open?

347
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,388
- Who the hell are you?
- He's Heisenberg.

348
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,891
- Is this drivable?
- Yeah. I was changing the oil.

349
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,311
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean,
take it out to the desert.

350
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,812
Come on, help me.

351
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,190
Hold up. What's this about?

352
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:36,652
The DEA,
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

353
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,987
You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

354
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:43,408
They know all about this RV
and they're trying to find it right now.

355
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:45,994
I want this off my property now.

356
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:48,580
No, no, we have got
to destroy the... evidence.

357
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,376
- We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
- Not here. Get it out of here.

358
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,795
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

359
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,257
If I go down, we all go down.
Do you understand?

360
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,260
All right, just...

361
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:05,264
I know a way. I know a guy that'll
wipe this off the planet, no questions.

362
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:06,682
Call him.

363
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:14,439
Hey, what about Jesse?

364
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,732
What about him?

365
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,371
Hey, it's me.
Wanna hear something weird?

366
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,541
Now, listen to me.
You get that address.

367
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:37,045
Now, Badger, I don't care how.
You find out where he's taking it.

368
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,676
Oh, yeah.

369
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,864
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

370
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:21,507
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths
are for paying customers only.

371
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:25,969
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.

372
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,351
What can I do for you?

373
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,688
You know.

374
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,860
Sunset.

375
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:05,926
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.

376
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,178
Beyond recovery, right?

377
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:11,515
- Beyond recovery means...
- I got it. Beyond recovery.

378
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,101
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Hey, don't worry.

379
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,312
When we're through with it,
it's gonna be about yay big.

380
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:21,191
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach,
ship it across the Pacific.

381
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,653
Chinese turn it into patio furniture...

382
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,197
...so mind at ease.

383
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,868
Listen, can you do me a favour?
I'm obviously gonna need a ride.

384
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,954
- Could you call a cab?
- You got it. Pleasure doing business.

385
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,499
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

386
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,165
- The hell you think you're doing?
- Me?

387
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,502
This is mine just as much as yours.
You don't get to just...

388
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,712
- Oh, God.
- What?

389
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,011
What?

390
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,180
He's here.

391
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,140
Who's here?

392
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,563
Oh, no.

393
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,277
Oh, God.

394
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:48,612
Oh, God.

395
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,240
You led him right to us.

396
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,981
Shit.

397
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,739
Shit.

398
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,408
Mr. Pinkman,
you wanna add resisting arrest?

399
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,578
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

400
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:23,290
Last chance to do it the... easy way.

401
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,998
Got a warrant?

402
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:09,628
Who are you, huh? Who are you
and what do you know about this RV?

403
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,922
Well, I'm the owner of this lot...

404
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,467
...which means you're trespassing
on private property.

405
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,470
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked...

406
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:23,475
...which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

407
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:28,313
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counsellor.

408
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:32,317
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

409
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,945
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

410
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,739
See these round rubber things?

411
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,283
Those are wheels.

412
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:40,951
This is a vehicle.

413
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,746
This is a domicile, a residence...

414
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:49,877
...protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

415
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:53,130
- Why don't you just go out...?
- Did you see this drive?

416
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:54,631
How do you know it runs?

417
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,676
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

418
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:01,763
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

419
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,643
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

420
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,189
Oh, yeah?

421
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,858
Look at these.

422
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:20,240
What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

423
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:24,870
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

424
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,916
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

425
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,584
Call the Albuquerque police...

426
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:36,048
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

427
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,257
What?

428
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:41,428
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

429
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,555
Say it. Say it.

430
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:47,142
- DEA operation, there's 20 guys
rushing in here like the wrath of God.

431
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:50,979
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

432
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,439
That's right.

433
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:55,359
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

434
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,113
There's somebody in there.

435
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:04,660
"Private domicile
and I won't be harassed."

436
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:09,540
I'll give you three seconds
to get your ass out here. One, two...

437
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:13,669
This is my own private domicile
and I will not be harassed.

438
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,796
Bitch.

439
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,641
Fine. You want your warrant?

440
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:34,439
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it
on a little satin pillow. How's that?

441
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:39,069
I waited this long.
I'll wait a little longer.

442
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,133
Hey, Vicky.

443
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,844
Yeah, Schrader.
Get me Merkert, will you?

444
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,607
You know, I say...

445
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,692
I say we just ram him.

446
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,360
All right?

447
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,238
I mean, we... We...

448
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:27,784
We start her up
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

449
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:30,537
We make our escape. Right?

450
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,463
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

451
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,759
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

452
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:47,262
So, what do we do, man, huh?

453
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:50,057
What do we...? What?

454
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:56,188
Please tell me you got something.

455
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,820
Yeah, I got something.

456
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,376
It's me.

457
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,128
We need your help.

458
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:43,694
Yeah.

459
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,572
<i>Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

460
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,115
Yeah. Who's this?

461
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,743
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner</i>
<i>with the Albuquerque police.</i>

462
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,620
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

463
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:55,706
Yes, why?

464
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:59,084
<i>I'm sorry to inform you your wife's</i>
<i>been in an automobile accident.</i>

465
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,837
<i>She's being airlifted</i>
<i>to Los Ranchos Medical Center...</i>

466
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:04,423
<i>...and should be arriving there</i>
<i>shortly.</i>

467
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:11,805
- How is she? What's her condition?
<i>- I don't have the current information.</i>

468
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:14,975
<i>But I think you might wanna get there</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

469
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:18,979
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

470
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,205
- Marie?
<i>- I'm just checking in.</i>

471
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:22,167
<i>I'd love to have some idea</i>
<i>of whether I should cook dinner or not.</i>

472
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:25,587
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

473
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,339
<i>Why?</i>

474
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,844
<i>Hank?</i>

475
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:34,221
<i>What's up?</i>

476
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,576
I told you before.

477
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:03,912
You will not kill Walter White.

478
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:08,250
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

479
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,961
We've waited long enough.

480
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,672
We won't wait any longer.

481
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,967
You'll have to.

482
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:18,844
The decision...

483
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,138
...is not yours to make.

484
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:29,146
Explain to me, why this man White?

485
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:35,652
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

486
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,698
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

487
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,910
Was there not another man...

488
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:45,454
...who pulled the trigger?

489
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:48,081
A DEA agent.

490
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:51,293
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

491
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,672
North of the border is my territory.

492
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:57,549
My say.

493
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,012
As a show of respect...

494
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,306
...I say yes.

495
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:17,402
The agent's name is...

496
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,446
...Hank Schrader.

497
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:26,954
May his death satisfy you.
