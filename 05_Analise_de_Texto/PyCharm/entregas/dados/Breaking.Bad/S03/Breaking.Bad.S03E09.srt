1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:07,549
<i>In the little village where I was born,</i>
<i>life moved at a slower pace...</i>

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,553
<i>...yet felt all the richer for it.</i>

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>There, my two uncles were known far</i>
<i>and wide for their delicious cooking.</i>

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,937
<i>They seasoned their zesty chick en...</i>

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,565
<i>...using only the freshest herbs</i>
<i>and spices.</i>

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:27,027
<i>People called them</i>
<i>Los Pollos Hermanos...</i>

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>..."The Chick en Brothers."</i>

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>Today, we carry on their tradition...</i>

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,993
<i>...in a manner that would mak e</i>
<i>my uncles proud.</i>

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,956
<i>The finest ingredients are brought</i>
<i>together with loving care...</i>

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,543
<i>...then slow-cook ed to perfection.</i>

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:48,090
<i>Yes, the old ways are still best</i>
<i>at Los Pollos Hermanos.</i>

13
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:53,679
<i>But don't tak e my word for it.</i>
<i>One taste and you'll know.</i>

14
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,166
Two-oh-one-point-six.

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,460
Jesus, seriously.

16
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,921
Better over than under.

17
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,257
Over by a pound and a half.

18
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,968
I thought you were all, like, precise.

19
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,513
Whatever.
We'll just save it out till next week.

20
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,557
We ship it as is.

21
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,811
What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

22
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,480
Leave it. One batch, one ship.

23
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,275
Stop complicating things.

24
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,534
Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?

25
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,037
These bitches are bleeding us
enough already.

26
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,707
You are paid extraordinarily well.

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,794
- Why can't you just appreciate that?
- Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

28
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,297
- Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,966
And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out...

30
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,177
...that this deal you made is bullshit.

31
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,846
- We both earn...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

32
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,183
A million and a half each.

33
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,353
What's he getting, huh?

34
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,524
Say he's wholesaling at
40 large a pound.

35
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,318
That's probably high.

36
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,988
High. What, for our stuff?
That's what I was getting.

37
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,657
All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

38
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,911
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

39
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,956
And, like, what happens at the... end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

40
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:12,127
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

41
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,338
Twenty-four hundred
times 40,000 is...

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,549
And I swear to God,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

43
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,093
Ninety-six million dollars.

44
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,555
Ninety-six million dollars.

45
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,683
All right? Ninety-six million.

46
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,686
Ninety-six to our three.

47
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,688
That is messed up, yo.

48
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,857
That is so messed up.

49
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,568
- Fairness-wise, I can't even...
- Jesse.

50
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:42,366
You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,536
What world do you live in?

52
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:50,582
One where the dudes who are actually
doing all the work ain't getting fisted.

53
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,709
What is going on with you lately?

54
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,962
What's happened to you?

55
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,714
Hang on, can't we just...?

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,884
Hey, we gotta hash this out.

57
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,264
Hey, what's more important
than money?

58
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,686
These things they laughingly
call pillows...

59
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,772
...I would not give them
to prison inmates.

60
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,899
You want me to go ask for another?

61
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,152
No, just remind me to bring his
from home.

62
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,866
They're not moving his legs enough.

63
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,200
Hey, everybody.

64
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:33,792
Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,173
Yeah.

66
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,810
His colour looks good.

67
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,065
Gomey, is that you?

68
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,193
Buddy, yeah, it's me.

69
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,154
That's you, Gomey?

70
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,199
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

71
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,868
Come here. Closer.

72
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:13,040
- What is it?
- Closer.

73
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,128
Asshole.

74
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,508
Man, he got you good.

75
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,805
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humour.

77
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,100
God.

78
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,148
Hey, check this out.

79
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,527
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

80
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:46,031
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,034
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

82
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:54,915
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

83
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,708
Even right here in town.

84
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,254
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

85
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,047
Man, it's crazy.

86
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,093
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

87
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,220
Because you were right.

88
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,556
You're the only one that
saw this coming.

89
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,140
Well, three cheers for me.

90
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,105
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

91
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,649
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

92
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,359
It's been an hour, right?

93
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,946
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

94
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,782
I'll go find somebody.

95
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,744
Hey, no more shop talk.

96
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,538
Sorry.

97
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,003
I didn't see it coming.

98
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,256
What? Damn right, you did.

99
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,633
No, I didn't see shit.

100
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,179
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

101
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,603
The only reason I'm even breathing...

102
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,523
...is I got a warning call.

103
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,944
A warning call? What do you mean?

104
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,532
One minute
before they attacked me...

105
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:14,912
...somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

106
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,415
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

107
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:23,337
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

108
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,508
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

109
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,135
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

110
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,056
- Who would have called to warn you?
- I don't know.

111
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,850
Oh, Jesus.

112
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,229
- Come on already.
- Okay.

113
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,982
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

114
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,322
Are we safe?

115
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,784
Yes.

116
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,213
Are you safe?

117
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
Absolutely.

118
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,539
Jesse?

119
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,918
Jesse?

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,629
What about you?

121
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,298
Face looks better.

122
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,718
How's it all going?
Anything you wanna tell us about?

123
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,348
What, like my interesting life?

124
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,977
One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

125
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,438
Been working a lot.

126
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,816
- Got a job.
- Job is good.

127
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,862
It's in a Laundromat.
It's totally corporate.

128
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,239
Corporate Laundromat.

129
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,825
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
My boss is a dick.

130
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,537
The owner, super dick.

131
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,374
I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

132
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,043
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags...

133
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:12,422
...the hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so...

134
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,342
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

135
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,303
Yeah.

136
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,932
Totally Kafkaesque.

137
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,770
Majorly.

138
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,899
From the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.

139
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,235
Very nice.

140
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,321
You've got all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

141
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,908
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

142
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,952
- Yeah.
- Look at these, Hank.

143
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,996
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Beautiful.

144
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,417
Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

145
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,171
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks...

146
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,923
...and some fancy designer olives.

147
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,719
You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

148
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,430
"Get well and best wishes
from Ted Beneke...

149
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,224
...and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

150
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,519
Wow, he gives you all this time off
and now this.

151
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,564
- Get me a job there.
- I know. He's great.

152
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,984
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

153
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,528
They're gonna have to get
on the stick.

154
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,741
- How's everybody doing today?
- Good. We're good.

155
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,827
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

156
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,748
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
a quick peripheral response, all right?

157
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,834
- See where we're at.
- Moment of truth?

158
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,961
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

159
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,381
All right, let's just take a look here.

160
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,093
All right.

161
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,639
All right, now I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

162
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,811
All right.

163
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,022
How about this?

164
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,652
Okay.

165
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,780
How about now?

166
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,783
Do that one again, would you?

167
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,077
Right there?

168
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,207
- Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
- Okay, on a scale of one to ten...

169
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,961
...ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

170
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,629
Oh, I don't know.

171
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,300
- Four?
- Okay, four. Okay.

172
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,972
And how about there?

173
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,100
Yeah. A six.

174
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:33,939
Okay, good. And here.

175
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,025
Yeah, still there. A little less.

176
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,528
- A three.
- Okay.

177
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,947
All right, good.

178
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,408
Thank you very much, Hank.
Did good.

179
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,161
So this is good news, right?

180
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,746
Oh, yeah, definitely.

181
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,290
Gosh.

182
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,002
It looks like some ne... function
is returning.

183
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,087
Oh, thank God.

184
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,924
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

185
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:11,560
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

186
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,271
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

187
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,524
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

188
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,735
But you can't know for sure.

189
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,613
- No.
- When does he start physical therapy?

190
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,948
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

191
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:29,119
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorisation in the next few days.

192
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,954
Certainly by early next week.

193
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,539
Next week?

194
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,167
No, that's not gonna do it.

195
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,835
I've looked into this.

196
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:40,756
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

197
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,259
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

198
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,469
- Well...
- Actually...

199
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,805
...your plan's treatment programme
covers four sessions a week.

200
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,935
Actually, she asked the doctor.

201
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,440
Plan-wise, four treatments a week
is fairly typical.

202
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,693
And the therapists in your network
are mostly fine.

203
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,655
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

204
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:12,538
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists...

205
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,415
...wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

206
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,504
It's very hard to say, Marie.

207
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,967
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

208
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,427
Is it absolutely optimal?

209
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,556
You know, screw it.

210
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,226
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

211
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,604
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

212
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:42,025
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

213
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,194
Physical therapy is just
the beginning.

214
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:48,031
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home...

215
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,701
...occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

216
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,204
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

217
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,956
So what?

218
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,458
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

219
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,920
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures...

220
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,672
...they may never pay you back.

221
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:08,051
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

222
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,346
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

223
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,682
I can give you some names.

224
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,018
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

225
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,477
To hell with the plan.

226
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,501
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

227
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,712
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

228
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,714
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.

229
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,467
- Exfoliate.
- Maybe later.

230
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,802
Where's the maestro,
out parking the minivan?

231
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,387
Do I look like his shadow?

232
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,265
Who cares where he's at?
What am I doing here?

233
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,352
Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

234
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,815
But since the genius can't be bothered,
today's your lucky day.

235
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,443
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

236
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,070
What?

237
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,448
- This?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,910
You are now the owner
of this fine... establishment.

239
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,703
- For free?
- Free?

240
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:21,333
Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
No, not free.

241
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,670
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
highly profitable...

242
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,171
At least potentially.

243
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,883
- Iocal institution looked upon with
favour by the Chamber of Commerce...

244
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:34,221
...Better Business Bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

245
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,765
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

246
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,602
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

247
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:46,233
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

248
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,737
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

249
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,740
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

250
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,369
Sit. Come on, come on.

251
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,122
Humour me here for a second.

252
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,917
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

253
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,963
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

254
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,091
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

255
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,926
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

256
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,554
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

257
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,307
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

258
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,018
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

259
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:25,439
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

260
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,357
Okay, here's your cash.

261
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,485
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

262
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:34,448
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

263
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,326
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

264
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,869
Now, what does he see?

265
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,747
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house...

266
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,583
...unlimited cash supply and no job.

267
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,961
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

268
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,298
- I'm a drug dealer.
- Wrong.

269
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,885
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

270
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,387
What do they do?
They take... every penny...

271
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,766
...and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

272
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,560
What was your mistake?

273
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,146
You didn't launder your money.

274
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,942
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

275
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,986
Hand me that little thing... Bin.

276
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,323
This is the nail salon, right?

277
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:22,454
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

278
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,373
That's called layering.

279
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,250
Final step, integration.

280
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,920
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

281
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,131
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed...

282
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,968
...into nice, clean, taxable income...

283
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,222
...brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

284
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,769
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

285
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,354
I'm a criminal, yo.

286
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:53,068
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict...

287
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,863
...maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

288
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:59,157
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

289
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,368
No, that's 17 percent.

290
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,746
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

291
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,250
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

292
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,129
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

293
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,047
Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...

294
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,219
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

295
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,346
How is your brother-in-law?

296
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,475
He'll live.

297
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,938
Good. I'm glad.

298
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,235
Walter, you seem troubled.

299
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,362
How can I help you?

300
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:26,870
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

301
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:35,629
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us...

302
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:43,053
...and I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

303
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,599
That's the best way to do business.

304
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:54,022
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked...

305
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,733
...someone called to warn him.

306
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:02,406
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

307
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:07,536
Those two men, the assassins...

308
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,956
...I believe I was their prime target.

309
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:16,712
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

310
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:24,052
Because of this inte... ntion...

311
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,722
...I am alive.

312
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:31,935
And yet I think that this person...

313
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,480
...was playing a much deeper game.

314
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:41,236
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

315
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:44,364
...not a silent assassination.

316
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:49,411
In one stroke,
he bloodied both sides...

317
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:55,000
...set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel...

318
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:59,546
...and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

319
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,971
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

320
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,477
...he would have the market
to himself.

321
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:20,692
The rewards would be... enormous.

322
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,077
We're both adults.

323
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:34,456
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

324
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:42,256
I want there to be no confusion.

325
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,635
I know I owe you my life.

326
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,642
And more than that...

327
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,437
...I respect the strategy.

328
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,608
In your position...

329
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,237
...I would have done the same.

330
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:16,456
One issue which troubles me...

331
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:24,006
...I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

332
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,926
What would you like to happen?

333
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,972
You know why I do this.

334
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,893
I want security for my family.

335
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,394
Then you have it.

336
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:41,231
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

337
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,569
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

338
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,114
Call it 15.

339
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,158
Open-ended.

340
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,327
Would that be agreeable?

341
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,935
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives...

342
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:46,940
...is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be...

343
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,986
...head off our disease before
it comes back.

344
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:55,157
So, anyone?

345
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,621
Free licence to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

346
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:06,376
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the Laundromat.

347
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:10,589
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted...

348
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,341
...what would you do?

349
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,344
Make more green, man. A lot more.

350
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,597
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

351
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,938
I don't know.

352
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:30,901
I guess I would make something.

353
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,945
Like what?

354
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,534
I don't know if it even matters...

355
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,663
...but work with my hands, I guess.

356
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:48,544
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

357
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:54,216
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

358
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:59,137
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

359
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:04,017
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of...

360
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,063
...Mr. Pike.

361
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,277
I guess he was like a Marine
or something before he got old.

362
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:14,570
He was hard of hearing.

363
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:19,116
My project for his class...

364
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:23,203
...was to make this wooden box.

365
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:27,207
You know, like a small...

366
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,004
Just like a...
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

367
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,966
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

368
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:39,219
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

369
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:44,933
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

370
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,978
So I finished it in a couple days.

371
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,399
And it looked pretty lame,
but it worked...

372
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,777
...you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

373
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,908
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...

374
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,368
...for my grade...

375
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:08,290
...he looked at it and said:

376
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,960
"Is that the best you can do?"

377
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,088
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell yeah, bitch.

378
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:21,011
Now give me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

379
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:28,894
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

380
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,439
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

381
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:37,986
He was just asking me honestly,
"Is that all you got?"

382
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:42,699
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

383
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:48,038
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

384
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,208
I made another, then another.

385
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:55,254
And by the... end of the semester,
by like box number five...

386
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:58,257
...I had built this thing.

387
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,387
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

388
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:09,518
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

389
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,395
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

390
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,607
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

391
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:21,655
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

392
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,448
It even smelled good.

393
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:27,911
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was...

394
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,125
It was perfect.

395
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,544
What happened to the box?

396
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:42,384
I gave it to my mom.

397
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,262
Nice.

398
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,724
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

399
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,976
It's never too late.

400
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:55,397
They have art co-ops
that offer classes...

401
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,108
...adult extension programme
at the university.

402
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:02,154
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

403
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,826
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

404
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,212
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

405
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,339
They'll say they're not denying
coverage.

406
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:21,965
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.

407
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,843
But I went through all this with Walt.

408
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:28,013
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

409
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,224
Well, you two managed, right?

410
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,558
You said yourself...

411
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:35,145
...that Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

412
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:40,651
- Jesus, I gotta get back.
- What? No.

413
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,194
No, no, no, you should rest.

414
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,364
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

415
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:49,201
- I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
- I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

416
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,412
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

417
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,417
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey.

418
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,338
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd stop by...

419
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,007
...to see how you're holding up.
Is this a bad time?

420
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,718
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:10,222
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

422
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,723
Oh, you're Ted.

423
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,017
I've heard so much about you.

424
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,853
Thank you for your gift basket.

425
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,647
- That was really thoughtful.
- It was nice. Thank you.

426
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,691
- Cheese sticks.
- Cheese sticks.

427
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,402
You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much...

428
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,363
...that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

429
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,575
Are you coming in?

430
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,244
Oh, yeah, you should.

431
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,539
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
- Thanks. Okay.

432
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,208
We were having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

433
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,211
No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

434
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,504
I just thought I'd...

435
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:47,342
You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

436
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,970
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

437
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,558
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

438
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,435
I will.

439
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,441
Thanks for stopping by...

440
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:07,029
...but it's actually not the best time
for a visit, so...

441
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:10,782
Can we just talk for a minute?

442
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,910
I know you need to be
with your family...

443
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,205
...but I haven't heard from you
in days...

444
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,248
...and I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

445
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:21,126
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've...

446
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:25,380
That's not my point.
I care about you. That's all.

447
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,175
Ted, I...
It's just this whole thing with Hank...

448
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:32,638
...has been one nonstop horror show,
you know, so...

449
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:37,351
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

450
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,603
Thank you.

451
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:44,816
But I really do need you to...

452
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,152
- Okay.
- Okay?

453
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,117
Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here...

454
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:59,331
...I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

455
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,209
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
okay?

456
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:05,295
- Is there some reason for secrecy?
- Later. Not now.

457
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,715
- Skyler, just tell me...
- You really wanna do this now?

458
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,343
Are you gonna make me do this
right now?

459
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,518
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:22,187
Bad idea to come here.

461
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,858
Ted, I'm...

462
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,778
I'll see you in a day or two.

463
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,197
Back at the office.

464
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,784
Take as much time as you want.

465
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,628
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

466
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,798
Must've been, like, depressing.

467
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,718
For real. That's a stone loss.

468
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,678
No one misses it more than me.

469
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:57,556
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

470
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,475
No quotas, no one to answer to.

471
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:05,105
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

472
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:10,402
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death Star.

473
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,488
True that. Two of them bitches.

474
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,659
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

475
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:22,080
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

476
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,585
- Church.
- Right.

477
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:32,299
Let's kick it back into gear.
All right? Let's start slinging again.

478
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,848
- Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
- Hells yeah, bitches.

479
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:44,353
We don't need no RV. All we need is
a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

480
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,940
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

481
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,359
Ain't top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.

482
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,237
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

483
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,447
And who says we sell on the street?

484
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,950
Maybe I know a whole new market.

485
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:01,203
Maybe all we need is the meth.

486
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,823
What's the yield?

487
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,034
Hey.

488
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,162
The yield. Come on.

489
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:47,666
Two-oh-one-point-eight.

490
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,978
I see a couple new faces.

491
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:11,023
Anybody wanna introduce
themselves?

492
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,526
Don't all speak at once.

493
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,159
Yeah.

494
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,831
So my name's Brandon.

495
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,294
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
something about yourself?

496
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,714
Well, why I'm here...

497
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:39,259
...it's just one thing.

498
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,803
It's meth.

499
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,682
It's bad.

500
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,728
Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
you know.

501
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,940
But then, Jesus...

502
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:57,236
...this new version of it
hit the streets...

503
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,406
...and, wow.
- Not that blue stuff.

504
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,493
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

505
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,662
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

506
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,540
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

507
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,960
- You had it too?
- Yeah, bro.

508
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,504
I wish I never even heard of it.

509
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,465
It was like lighting my whole head
on fire.

510
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,343
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

511
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:26,473
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

512
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,392
That's the shame of it.

513
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,353
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

514
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,522
I hear it's back in town.

515
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,112
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

516
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,990
It's gonna be okay.

517
00:38:56,336 --> 00:39:00,174
<i>I swear to God, I'll do it.</i>
<i>I will go to the press.</i>

518
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:04,344
I'll go to <i>48 Hours.</i> I'll go to <i>Nightline.</i>
Don't know if there's <i>Nightline</i> anymore.

519
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:07,806
Doesn't matter. They will all take it
and they will run with it...

520
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:14,021
...because he is a hero and he is not
going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

521
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:18,108
Jesus.

522
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:22,196
Listen, Marie.

523
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,074
I know Skyler's
already told you this...

524
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:30,370
...but if there's ever anything
that you need, anything at all...

525
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,415
It's good to have you here.

526
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,792
Both of you.

527
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:41,381
I just wish there was something more
that we could do.

528
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:50,057
Walt.

529
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,311
We can always pay their bills.

530
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:59,024
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

531
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:03,070
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

532
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:06,365
- Skyler.
- I think Marie should know the truth.

533
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:10,494
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

534
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:13,455
- I think that...
- He... earned it gambling.

535
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,920
Walt and I...

536
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,465
...we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

537
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:31,265
And what it all came down to really...

538
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:34,434
...was money.

539
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,937
Pure and simple.

540
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:39,731
When Walt was diagnosed...

541
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,485
...it changed him.

542
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,990
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood...

543
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,701
...what it was
that he was going through.

544
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,453
It was more than facing death.

545
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:56,874
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

546
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,669
...nothing.

547
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:06,133
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse...

548
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,844
...he wanted to provide.

549
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:16,268
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

550
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,398
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

551
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:23,609
Yeah, I thought so too.

552
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:27,112
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

553
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:31,700
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

554
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:33,869
Isn't that right?

555
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:42,294
So he put his mind to it and...

556
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:48,550
Well, you know how Walt is.

557
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,719
He's a problem-solver.

558
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:55,849
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research...

559
00:41:56,058 --> 00:42:00,854
...and he came up with this system.

560
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:02,898
A system?

561
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:07,194
A system for counting cards
in blackjack.

562
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:10,656
What do you mean, like <i>Rain Man?</i>

563
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:15,410
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details...

564
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:20,791
...but he was convinced that if he put
enough money into it, he'd have a...

565
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,835
God, what is it?

566
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,796
A statistical edge?

567
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,175
Yes, statistical...

568
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,094
- So...
- Yeah.

569
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:36,890
So he... every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

570
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,311
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realised that...

571
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:49,361
But then he realised that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

572
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,114
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

573
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:56,451
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

574
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,039
Like an illegal backroom game.

575
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:06,461
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

576
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:10,924
...all that time he used to spend
away from home?

577
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:16,054
I guess for a couple months there...

578
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:19,433
...you were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

579
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,105
Oh, my God.

580
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,443
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

581
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,696
- Was that some sort of cover?
- No, no.

582
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,032
He did not fake that, Marie.

583
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,784
The night that Walt disappeared...

584
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:44,833
...he lost $14,000.

585
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,339
It was his pension fund,
our savings...

586
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:55,886
...basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

587
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:59,223
He couldn't live with it.

588
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,308
He was suicidal.

589
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:06,355
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital...

590
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:12,277
...he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

591
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:17,491
How could you do that to her, Walt?

592
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,662
Anyway, this system of his?

593
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,999
He finally got it to work.

594
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,547
So all this is to say
we have the money.

595
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:34,716
No more gambling.

596
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,554
But we have the money.

597
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:44,852
How much money?

598
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:46,895
Walt?

599
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,443
Well...

600
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,534
...it's into seven figures.

601
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,913
Holy Mary, mother of God.

602
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,666
What can I say?

603
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,878
I did very well.

604
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:13,797
Marie...

605
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:18,218
...you will take our money.

606
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:22,598
Use it to take care of Hank.

607
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,269
Please. Marie, let us help.

608
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:32,608
- Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
- Absolutely not.

609
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,860
And I need to keep it that way.

610
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:37,821
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

611
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,533
- Can we please keep this between us?
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

612
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,661
Yeah, I just... I need to...

613
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,956
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

614
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:51,752
How did you come up with that?

615
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:55,589
I mean, where did you possibly...?

616
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:59,676
I learned from the best.

617
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,392
Somehow...

618
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:12,773
...something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

619
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:17,611
And I'm not forgetting that.
