00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,925
<i>We interrupt scheduled programming</i>
<i>to bring you this breaking news.</i>

2
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>In the last several minutes...</i>

3
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,554
<i>...KOB has received</i>
<i>dozens of reports...</i>

4
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,225
<i>...of what appears to be a crashed</i>
<i>aircraft, possibly two aircraft...</i>

5
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,185
<i>...on Albuquerque's east side.</i>

6
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,978
<i>As of yet details are scarce...</i>

7
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,190
<i>...but callers describe witnessing</i>
<i>an explosion overhead...</i>

8
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,442
<i>...followed by falling debris.</i>
<i>Visible now...</i>

9
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,987
<i>- Crash investigators with the</i>
<i>National Transportation Safety Board...</i>

10
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,990
<i>...are expected on site</i>
<i>as early as this evening.</i>

11
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,119
<i>But officials warn that with a debris field</i>
<i>of this magnitude, the investigation...</i>

12
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,997
<i>Officials are now saying</i>
<i>that the Boeing 737...</i>

13
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,501
<i>...was being re-routed,</i>
<i>or vectored, through the airspace...</i>

14
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,963
<i>...which is standard procedure</i>
<i>according to a spok esman for the FAA.</i>

15
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>The eight-seat King Air 350</i>
<i>was a charter flight...</i>

16
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,887
<i>...operating out of St. George, Utah,</i>
<i>bound for Amarillo, Texas.</i>

17
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,140
<i>It sounded lik e hail,</i>
<i>lik e heavy hailstones.</i>

18
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,271
<i>It was just bump-bump-bump,</i>
<i>all over the neighbourhood...</i>

19
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,109
<i>- Indicating that the final death toll</i>
<i>now stands at 167.</i>

20
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,071
<i>- One hundred and sixty-seven.</i>

21
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,574
<i>This mid-air collision</i>
<i>has left many wondering...</i>

22
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,536
<i>...how such an accident could tak e place</i>
<i>in a system with so many safeguards.</i>

23
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,205
<i>- That the collision</i>
<i>which brought down Flight 515...</i>

24
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,834
<i>...was caused</i>
<i>by improper air traffic control.</i>

25
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,879
<i>We have the bombshell confirmation</i>
<i>out of Oklahoma City...</i>

26
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,297
<i>...as the FAA confirmed...</i>

27
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,384
<i>...it was indeed a lone</i>
<i>air traffic controller's fateful mistak e...</i>

28
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,178
<i>...which brought about the crash.</i>

29
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,056
<i>- Is Donald Margolis,</i>
<i>a 19-year veteran...</i>

30
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,352
<i>...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic</i>
<i>Control Center in Albuquerque...</i>

31
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,231
<i>- Margolis recently returned to work</i>
<i>after a five-week absence...</i>

32
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,692
<i>...which was due to, quote,</i>
<i>"a personal loss".</i>

33
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,779
<i>While it's now known that Margolis</i>
<i>had recently lost a daughter to a...</i>

34
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,448
<i>- Drug overdose a month before.</i>

35
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,451
<i>His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,</i>
<i>aged 26...</i>

36
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,662
<i>...apparently had a long history</i>
<i>of substance abuse.</i>

37
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,164
<i>Friends of the family say...</i>

38
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,334
<i>...the death of his only child</i>
<i>hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

39
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,296
<i>Coming as it did</i>
<i>little more than a month before...</i>

40
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,341
<i>...many are questioning</i>
<i>the timing of his return to work...</i>

41
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,843
<i>...and are wondering</i>
<i>how much blame truly lies...</i>

42
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,262
<i>...with those</i>
<i>who let this grieving father...</i>

43
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,920
I usually open with
"So sorry you're here".

44
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,214
Where would you like to begin?

45
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,467
I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

46
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:33,472
As quick as something like this
can be. So...

47
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,102
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

48
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,522
Does he know?

49
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,484
Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

50
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,110
Has he moved out?

51
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,404
We're in the process
of moving him out.

52
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,781
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

53
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,952
And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter...

54
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,870
...and I are staying with my sister.

55
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,749
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.

56
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,210
Only so he could
get his things and...

57
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:07,339
That was supposed to happen last week,
but then came the crash and...

58
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,383
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?

59
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,469
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

60
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:19,017
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighbourhood, so...

61
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,020
- Terrible.
- Yeah. Apparently, even...

62
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,148
...you know, parts of bodies.

63
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:29,987
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to...

64
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,155
- So awful.
- I know.

65
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,659
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

66
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:40,747
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

67
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:44,543
Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

68
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,422
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

69
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,840
Two children, you said?

70
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:56,805
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

71
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,144
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.

72
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,397
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

73
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,275
And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

74
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,695
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage...?

75
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:16,825
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

76
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,870
What about other debts or assets?

77
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,122
Do you feel
you have a good understanding...

78
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,625
...of you and your husband's
financial situation?

79
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,964
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

80
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:35,385
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes...

81
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,890
...or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.

82
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,436
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting...

83
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:48,732
...of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

84
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,903
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

85
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:59,159
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

86
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,400
Walt?

87
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,402
Hey, buddy?

88
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,207
Hey, Walt?

89
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,585
- Hey.
- There you are.

90
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,671
Listen, I... You know, well...

91
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,132
It's...

92
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,176
It's time.

93
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,601
The shittiest week since 9<i>l</i>11, okay?
Bar none.

94
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,686
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

95
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,062
I speak with authority...

96
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,940
...because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

97
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,358
But this here? I mean...

98
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,695
...call freaking Guinness Book
of World Records, call freaking...

99
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,198
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

100
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,368
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.

101
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,038
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

102
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,290
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

103
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,292
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

104
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,836
You beat a little tactical retreat...

105
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,423
...you regroup, and then:

106
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:41,803
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.

107
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,019
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.

108
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,653
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

109
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,696
I got it.

110
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,784
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

111
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,456
Half a million in cash.

112
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,005
That's the spirit.

113
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,511
I got it, I got it.

114
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,826
<i>Who's here for self-improvement?</i>

115
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,247
Come on, give me a show of hands.

116
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:57,462
Who among you is here hoping they
can actively improve who they are?

117
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,430
All right. See, that's your first mistake.

118
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,100
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

119
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,943
Hey, honey,
you want another waffle?

120
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:25,908
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

121
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:32,164
<i>Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn</i>
<i>and Holly. Please leave us a message.</i>

122
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,584
<i>Hey. Hello, everybody.</i>
<i>Good morning.</i>

123
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,169
<i>I was just checking in...</i>

124
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,923
<i>...and thought I'd pass along</i>
<i>the current contact information.</i>

125
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,383
<i>You certainly</i>
<i>can always reach me on my cell...</i>

126
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,721
<i>...I've always got that on me,</i>
<i>but in terms of a mailing address...</i>

127
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,973
<i>...I'm here at the Beachcomber...</i>

128
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,644
<i>...and you know what,</i>
<i>it's actually very nice, very pleasant.</i>

129
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,396
<i>Not as high-end as the Oakwood,</i>
<i>but not as corporate...</i>

130
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:01,068
- Oh, hey, would you please just...?
- Hey, Dad, it's me.

131
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,403
No, I'm not okay.

132
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,239
I don't know what's going on.

133
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,366
Nobody's telling me jackshit
around here.

134
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,618
- Hey, Flynn.
- Whatever.

135
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,578
I don't even care anymore.

136
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,164
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

137
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:19,586
- I'll take you to school.
- Yeah. No, I'm ready now.

138
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,923
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

139
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:28,262
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

140
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,292
Okay.

141
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,178
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

142
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,140
<i>As all of you know, last week</i>
<i>our city suffered a terrible tragedy.</i>

143
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,100
<i>One that none of us will ever forget.</i>

144
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:00,979
<i>Which is why today we're going to</i>
<i>tak e a little time out of our schedule...</i>

145
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,774
<i>...to gather in the gym and talk.</i>

146
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:11,490
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

147
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:17,287
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

148
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,333
It just really
gets inside your brain and...

149
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,588
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself...

150
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:30,509
...like, if you come home and find him
hanging in the closet or whatever...

151
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,596
...it's basically an automatic A
for you.

152
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:38,308
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is...

153
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,186
- Is something to...
- Okay. Thank you, Barry.

154
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,938
Who wants to go next?

155
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,569
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

156
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:54,408
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

157
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,413
There you go, honey.

158
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,750
I just keep asking myself...

159
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:07,004
Honey, could you please stand up?

160
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,798
Thank you.

161
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,468
I just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

162
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,972
I mean, if there's a God and all...

163
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,726
...why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

164
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,188
Okay, can we just keep it secular,
honey?

165
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,983
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

166
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,444
Does anyone... else have that?

167
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,491
I just keep hearing that sound.

168
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,537
That boom.

169
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:45,792
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

170
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,090
Thank you, sweetheart.

171
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,178
- Is there anyone... else?
- Over here.

172
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,978
My neighbour, he heard the crash...

173
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:09,274
...and he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

174
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,527
Like an airline seat.

175
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,445
Like what you have on a airliner?

176
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:18,283
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard...

177
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:23,080
...right next to his Sea-Doos,
because, like, he has Sea-Doos.

178
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,709
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

179
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,170
Human legs.

180
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,841
Jesus H. Christ.

181
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,888
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm...

182
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,225
I was just moved.

183
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,353
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

184
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:51,733
Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

185
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,903
Mr. White,
would you like to say something?

186
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,032
And by the way, welcome back.

187
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,878
It's so good to have you back.

188
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:31,565
I guess what I would... Sorry, sorry.

189
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,946
I guess what I would wanna say is...

190
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,951
...to look on the bright side.

191
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,832
First of all,
nobody on the ground was killed.

192
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,459
And that...

193
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:55,130
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban centre?

194
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:01,094
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So...

195
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:04,556
Plus, neither plane was full.

196
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:11,188
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

197
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,774
Or maybe... even three-quarters full?

198
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:18,487
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise...

199
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:22,741
...is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

200
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,869
Actually, tied for 50th.

201
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,872
There are, in truth...

202
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,378
...53 crashes throughout history...

203
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,841
...that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

204
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:43,011
Has anybody...?
Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?

205
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,350
In 1977, two fully loaded 747 s...

206
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,061
...crashed into each other on Tenerife.

207
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,274
Does anybody know how big
a 747 is?

208
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,653
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

209
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:04,157
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

210
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:09,955
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

211
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:16,253
You know why?
It's because people move on.

212
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,630
They just move on.

213
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,342
And we will too. We will move on,
and we will get past this.

214
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:29,308
Because that is what human beings do,
we survive, and...

215
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:35,022
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.

216
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,401
We survive. We survive and...

217
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,030
- Okay?
- Thank you.

218
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,449
Good.

219
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,860
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

220
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,240
Fine. I guess.

221
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,952
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, will you?

222
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,122
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.

223
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,084
No, I...

224
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,704
He's gone.

225
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,793
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

226
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,046
- How's what?
- Tricks. It's an expression.

227
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,923
How are you?

228
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:33,302
Why you gotta treat him like this?

229
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,970
Why you gotta be like this?

230
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,683
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

231
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,406
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

232
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,330
You know, try not to hold it
against him.

233
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:07,169
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

234
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:12,716
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

235
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:16,470
He's probably wondering, "What is it
that could have gone so wrong...

236
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,348
- Marie. Marie.
...that my mother would leave...?"

237
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,308
I can't help you get through this...

238
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,561
...you know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did?

239
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,273
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

240
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,902
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

241
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,029
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."

242
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:38,283
...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.

243
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,002
It's that voice inside your head.

244
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:55,050
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24<i>l</i>7 voice.

245
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,803
You know what I'm talking about.

246
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,764
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

247
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,977
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

248
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,354
...president of the United States?

249
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,858
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

250
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,734
But now...

251
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:17,739
...are you good enough to dese...
your share of basic human happiness?

252
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:22,911
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

253
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,330
I say yes.

254
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,670
But it doesn't matter what I say.

255
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,965
It's your voice, which means
you're the one that hears it.

256
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:39,178
Which means you're the only one
that can fight it, right?

257
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:43,182
Jesse, we never hear from you.

258
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:49,188
What's going on? You can tell me
I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

259
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:52,816
Just come on. Let us in on it.

260
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,952
So, like, what makes you the... expert?

261
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,830
I don't think I ever said I was that.

262
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,708
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

263
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:16,715
Telling us "thus" and "so,... be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

264
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,260
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

265
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:25,641
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever...

266
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:31,730
...but did you ever really
hurt someone?

267
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,236
I killed my daughter.

268
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:47,663
It was July 18th,
which is my birthday.

269
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:52,209
July 18th, 1992.

270
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:56,046
I was high on cocaine
and I was drunk.

271
00:29:56,255 --> 00:30:00,509
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

272
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,177
I had plenty left.

273
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,972
But I was out of vodka.

274
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,057
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...

275
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,519
...where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets...

276
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,479
...they have these ABC stores...

277
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:18,610
...which close at 5 p.m.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

278
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,698
So I'm arguing with my wife.

279
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,702
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me,
it's my birthday.

280
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,456
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me".

281
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,835
And she's saying "No, no."

282
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:40,883
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

283
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:45,554
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

284
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,892
She's playing
at the... end of the driveway.

285
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,604
So...

286
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,404
How do you not hate yourself?

287
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,617
I did hate myself for a long time.

288
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:11,747
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

289
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,625
It just made it that much worse.

290
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:21,298
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

291
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,176
It just stands in the way.

292
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,429
Stands in the way of what?

293
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,015
True change.

294
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,214
Skyler.

295
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,591
Is this a good time to talk?

296
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,387
Yeah. Come in. Please.

297
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,978
Skyler.

298
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:38,458
Do you wanna start?

299
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,720
Okay.

300
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:13,994
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?

301
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:18,248
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.

302
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:23,712
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.

303
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:29,885
I am happily married. I am happy.
We're just...

304
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:41,980
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.

305
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:49,488
Would you even consider...?
I mean, Jesus!

306
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:53,116
You come in here and you wave
these papers in my face...

307
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:58,330
...when there's a whole other,
entire side to this thing.

308
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:02,501
There's your side and there's my side,
and you haven't heard my side yet.

309
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,419
You haven't heard any of it at all.

310
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,755
You're a drug dealer.

311
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:14,972
No. What...? How...? What?

312
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,275
Yeah.

313
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:31,655
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

314
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:40,622
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

315
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,840
No?

316
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:55,053
Oh, my God, Walt.

317
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:58,932
Cocaine?

318
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,771
It's methamphetamine.

319
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:12,112
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

320
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,533
...per se.

321
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:20,329
It doesn't mean... No, Skyler!

322
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:23,081
- Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
- No, no!

323
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,668
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

324
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:31,840
So please, let's... Please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

325
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,801
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

326
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,765
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

327
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,808
Nobody will hear it from me.

328
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:45,771
But only if you grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

329
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:48,482
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.

330
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:52,194
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

331
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,213
Bye, Jesse.

332
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,066
Your windshield's broken.

333
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,237
Yeah.

334
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,997
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

335
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,125
Strictly temporary. We're just...

336
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,544
We're just taking a little break.

337
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:55,299
That's you, over there.

338
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:00,179
Listen, money.

339
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,765
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better...

340
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,809
I'm better.

341
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:10,147
You're better? Really?

342
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:16,695
- What, the rehab? It helped?
- Yeah. I'm done using.

343
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,949
That's excellent. That's...

344
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:26,955
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

345
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:33,921
You know,
in spite of how bad things got...

346
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:38,717
...it really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

347
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:43,847
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again...

348
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:48,185
...and on the straight and narrow.

349
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,941
You been following
this airplane crash?

350
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,194
Yeah.

351
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:02,157
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together...

352
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,409
...because he was so torn up?

353
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:07,788
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

354
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,499
You are not responsible for this.

355
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,836
Not in any way, shape or form,
all right?

356
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:18,423
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are...

357
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:22,511
...and there are many factors
at play there.

358
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,137
Yeah?

359
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:29,518
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet...

360
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,436
...that may not have been working.

361
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,772
That's public record.
You can look that up.

362
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:37,568
And the whole system
is run on 1960s technology.

363
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:39,027
No.

364
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:44,241
No, really, I blame the government.

365
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:50,914
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

366
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:55,002
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.

367
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,756
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

368
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:02,885
I accept who I am.

369
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,344
And who are you?

370
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,182
I'm the bad guy.

371
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,160
Here's some napkins for you.

372
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,329
Enjoy.

373
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,711
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.

374
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,422
It's good to see you again.

375
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,677
- May I?
- Please.

376
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:54,853
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

377
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:01,693
I actually am not here to...

378
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:10,035
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect...

379
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,746
...to tell you this personally.

380
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:16,625
I'm done.

381
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,713
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

382
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:25,008
I find you
extraordinarily professional...

383
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,511
...and I appreciate
the way you do business.

384
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:33,225
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

385
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:38,981
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads...

386
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:44,862
...and it's brought me
to a realization.

387
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,741
I am not a criminal.

388
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,663
No offence to any people who are...

389
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,587
...but this is not me.

390
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,842
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

391
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,096
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

392
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:15,517
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

393
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:21,648
Three months, then out.

394
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,531
Three million?

395
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:34,953
May I take this as a "yes"?

396
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:48,342
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

397
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:53,096
What I don't have is my family.

398
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,392
The answer is still no.

399
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,442
Enjoy your meal.

400
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,033
Thank you.

401
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:47,359
That's it!

402
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,403
Did you feel it?

403
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:52,072
Texas!

404
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,533
I've made this trip three times...

405
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,619
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

406
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,413
...and that's how you know!

407
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,999
We are officially in Texas!

408
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:11,341
This time I got a job waiting for me.

409
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:15,637
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

410
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:17,264
Yo, that's for me, homes!

411
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:22,394
They call me".Olive Oil" because
I paint them slick.

412
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:28,275
I do pearlescent, colour-shift,
you name it.

413
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,029
I painted cars for some of...

414
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,573
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.

415
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:38,911
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

416
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:43,332
Not much good for working, but...

417
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:46,960
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...

418
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,327
What the hell's going on in there?
