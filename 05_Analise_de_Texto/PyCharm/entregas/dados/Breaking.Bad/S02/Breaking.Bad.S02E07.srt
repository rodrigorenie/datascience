1
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,650
<i>The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico</i>

2
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:30,036
<i>Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated</i>

3
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:35,332
<i>'Cause of the new drug they created</i>

4
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:49,472
<i>They say the colour is blue
And the quality pure</i>

5
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:59,648
<i>This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city</i>

6
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:04,987
<i>And no one could stop it
If they wanted to</i>

7
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:13,662
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect</i>

8
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,669
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now</i>

9
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:27,426
<i>No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face</i>

10
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:31,681
<i>The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving</i>

11
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:39,438
<i>But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet</i>

12
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,669
<i>Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan</i>

13
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:08,384
<i>From way far away
They want to taste that meth</i>

14
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:14,223
<i>That blue stuff has crossed the border</i>

15
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,858
<i>Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name</i>

16
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:37,413
<i>Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding</i>

17
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:43,794
<i>Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"</i>

18
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:51,927
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect</i>

19
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:58,851
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now</i>

20
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:06,484
<i>No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face</i>

21
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:10,863
<i>The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet</i>

22
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:15,284
<i>But that homey's dead</i>

23
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:18,788
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

24
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:49,360
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn...

25
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,322
You do know what a bond is?

26
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,745
A strong force of attraction.

27
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:03,124
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

28
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:07,712
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

29
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,380
No?

30
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:15,594
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

31
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:19,890
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

32
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:24,353
What hold us together.
-Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

33
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:25,563
Bonds.

34
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,401
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

35
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,822
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

36
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,413
What is "close"?

37
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,582
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

38
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,710
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

39
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,171
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

40
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,425
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

41
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:58,596
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

42
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:04,435
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

43
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,438
Like, all night, hard.

44
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:11,942
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

45
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:17,990
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit...

46
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,576
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

47
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,797
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

48
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,428
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

49
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:26,017
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

50
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:30,813
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

51
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:36,360
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

52
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,490
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the...

53
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,368
When I said, "Handle it."

54
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:48,706
Well, don't. Just let it go.

55
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,416
All right.

56
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:11,395
Come on.

57
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,607
Jesse, open the door.

58
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:19,570
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

59
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,702
Can I help you?

60
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,372
No. Thank you.

61
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:33,876
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

62
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,420
You're the manager?

63
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,090
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

64
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:44,178
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key...

65
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:48,057
You have a key, right?
-Yeah, I have a key.

66
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,562
Look, the person who lives here...

67
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:56,691
...it's just very important
for me to see him.

68
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,777
And you knocked, right?
-Yeah.

69
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:01,987
He didn't answer?

70
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:04,532
Which means...?

71
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,206
Look, I'm his father, all right?
-You're Mr. Jackson?

72
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,961
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

73
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,170
And you are...?

74
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:21,757
Jane.
-Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

75
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,926
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

76
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,971
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

77
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:30,141
Wanna call him?
-No.

78
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:33,019
No. I-

79
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,689
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

80
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:40,359
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

81
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,153
You understand?

82
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,489
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

83
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,491
I don't get involved in family.

84
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,994
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

85
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,203
Period.

86
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,122
Sorry.

87
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:01,380
Come on in, Dad.

88
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,803
Thanks.
-You okay?

89
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:10,806
Yeah.

90
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,607
"Jesse Jackson"?

91
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,567
Do you even...?

92
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,572
Oh, I see you have a telephone,
at least.

93
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:30,117
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

94
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,453
Whatever, man.

95
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:38,084
Hey, give me my-Give-
-I will break this. I will break this!

96
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,837
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing...

97
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,215
...the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

98
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:48,219
No. I've been taking care of business.
-What business?

99
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:49,929
What business?

100
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:54,809
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

101
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,567
This business.

102
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:09,907
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

103
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,081
You didn't actually-?
-Hey, you said-

104
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,542
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

105
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,712
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

106
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,880
I meant get your money back.
I never meant-

107
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,174
Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
-No!

108
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:30,344
Well, too late, yo,
because dude's dead.

109
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,430
Oh, God.
-All right? Way dead.

110
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:36,767
Oh, God.
-Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

111
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,894
Here's your money.

112
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:44,900
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

113
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:50,614
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

114
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,313
I didn't say I killed him.

115
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,150
Tell me what happened.

116
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:31,989
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

117
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,493
Crushed his-?
-Crushed his head...

118
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,746
...with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

119
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:40,998
I mean, crushed it like...

120
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:45,670
Oh, my God, the sound...

121
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:47,630
...it's still in my ears.

122
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:50,549
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

123
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:56,013
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

124
00:11:56,222 --> 00:12:01,185
Man, will you just please give me-?
Just give me my weed, all right?

125
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:03,854
It helps with my nausea.

126
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,441
So...

127
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,695
...you did not kill anyone?

128
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,532
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

129
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,575
I called the cops.

130
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,036
You called the cops?

131
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:22,748
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

132
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,042
And then they came in
and busted her.

133
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,714
God, she was-
She was so zapped out of her mind.

134
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:33,300
You know? It's...
She did it for, like, nothing.

135
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,013
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

136
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:42,560
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

137
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:47,481
She couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

138
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,984
She was so zonked.

139
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:53,571
And she had this...

140
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:55,865
God, she had this kid.

141
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:59,493
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here...

142
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:04,665
...but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

143
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,669
Look, she had a gun on me,
all right?

144
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:18,054
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

145
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,097
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

146
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:24,310
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

147
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:28,230
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

148
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,740
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

149
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:40,951
<i>-Hey, it's Badger, man.
-What are you doing?</i>

150
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,955
<i>-Don't use your real name.
-What? That isn't my real name.</i>

151
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:47,208
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:52,755
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?</i>

153
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,466
<i>We got them just for you, jefe.</i>

154
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,135
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>

155
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:08,646
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

156
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:12,983
No.

157
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,112
You get on. All right?

158
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,281
I just want to forget. I just...

159
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,126
Sorry.

160
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,223
Hey.

161
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,642
Hey, what's up with that?

162
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:51,355
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

163
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,191
Well, yeah, hell,
I know who it is, okay?

164
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,986
Scumbags kneeling down
praying to him:

165
00:14:57,194 --> 00:15:02,366
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

166
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,586
I'm just-I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

167
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,506
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

168
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:23,137
Sun Tzu.
-Son who?

<i>Sixth-century Chinese general.

170
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,060
"If you know your enemy
as yourself...

171
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,812
...you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

172
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,234
Right on.

173
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,409
Agent Schrader.
-Sir.

174
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:49,789
Glad to have you onboard.
-Thanks.

175
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:53,876
Everybody getting you settled in?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

176
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:57,421
And gals. And gals.
Guys-Guys and gals.

177
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,341
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

178
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:03,219
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

179
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,054
Yes, sir.

180
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,836
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

181
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,798
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

182
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:44,635
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

183
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:51,976
Hey, watch it.
-It ain't real, dumb-ass.

184
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:53,310
Just watch it, is all.

185
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,312
You watch it.

186
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,158
I'm Heisenberg.

187
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,827
You're Heisenberg?

188
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,079
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

189
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,582
Let's get this over with.

190
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,417
Where's Jesse?

191
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,754
Busy.
-Hey, that's cool.

192
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,380
Real cool.

193
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,132
Totally cool.

194
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:24,800
Hey, hey-

195
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,555
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

196
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:32,933
Here?
-I'm just saying...

197
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,977
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

198
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,313
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations...

199
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,814
...as to who we work for.

200
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,234
And that's church, yo. For real.

201
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,991
What have you heard?

202
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,913
Did Jesse really...?

203
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,583
I mean, did he really...

204
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,630
...squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

205
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,173
Word.

206
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,680
Who's saying that?

207
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:14,934
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

208
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:17,812
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money...

209
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,772
...but today everybody's paying up.

210
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,900
True that. Serious.

211
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,985
But, like...

212
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:27,863
He really did it?

213
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:40,167
You didn't hear that from me.

214
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,157
Big lunch.

215
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,585
Thank you.

216
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:30,676
Here you go.
-Very good, Ms. White.

217
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,596
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

218
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,097
Thank you.

219
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,351
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

220
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,685
Really?

221
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,771
When are you due?

222
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,984
Several months.
-Congratulations.

223
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:51,947
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

224
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:53,574
Family.

225
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,787
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

226
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,463
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I-I think he'll remember me.

227
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,466
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

228
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,968
You know, if it's okay, I'll just-

229
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,639
Ma'am-

230
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:33,447
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

231
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:35,157
Hey, Ted.

232
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,660
Come in, come in.
-Okay.

233
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,496
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

234
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:42,206
Come on, sit down right here.

235
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,667
Okay. Thank you.

236
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:51,507
You look great.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

237
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:53,968
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

238
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:56,512
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

239
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,473
I'll bet. One of each.

240
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:01,934
How's Walt Jr.?

241
00:21:02,143 --> 00:21:05,771
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

242
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,523
He's-He's taller than I am now.

243
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:13,571
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

244
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,323
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

245
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,117
Good genes.

246
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:26,000
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

247
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,377
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

248
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,713
They're gorgeous.
-Yes, they are.

249
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,549
And they know it.

250
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,551
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

251
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,428
Yeah.

252
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,766
So the big office, huh?

253
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:43,684
Yeah.
-Yeah.

254
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:45,853
Weird, isn't it?

255
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,397
I still think of it as my dad's.

256
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:49,940
I miss him.

257
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:51,692
Me too.

258
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:57,740
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

259
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,076
Yeah, he'd be proud.

260
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:03,788
Walt? How's he doing?

261
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:08,959
Oh, he's-He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

262
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,588
Great. He's still teaching?
-Yeah.

263
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:17,593
You tell him I said hello.
-I will definitely do that.

264
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:26,727
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...

265
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,232
I was applying for the data-entry job.

266
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,276
You're kidding.

267
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,779
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

268
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:39,448
Yeah. Well...

269
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:42,118
...the economy, you know, so...

270
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:45,871
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

271
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,585
How about...

272
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,588
...get your old job back?

273
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:00,636
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

274
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:03,139
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

275
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,058
Your work would be cut out for you...

276
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,978
...but we could use your help.

277
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,485
Okay.

278
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:22,491
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

279
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,993
Hey. Hello.

280
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,537
Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
-Now, look at this.

281
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,664
Here, here, here and here.

282
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,959
What does that look like to you?

283
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:36,589
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

284
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:40,384
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

285
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,345
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

286
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:46,015
Because it's not our territory?
-Because we lack initiative.

287
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,516
Initiative.
-Yes.

288
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,685
You need to employ more dealers.

289
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,229
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

290
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:56,692
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

291
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,944
Exponential growth,
that's the key here.

292
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:04,909
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

293
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:07,787
We go rolling into
these neighbourhoods...

294
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:10,831
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

295
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:13,709
Sure, they won't like it...

296
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,796
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

297
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:18,964
No. Listen, Jesse-
-No.

298
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:20,800
Jesse.

299
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:28,015
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

300
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:32,019
What are you talking about?
-Apparently, it's all over town.

301
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,730
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

302
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:38,025
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

303
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,236
That's not how it happened.
-Who cares...

304
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:43,739
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

305
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:47,243
Oh, my-
-No, don't you see how great this is?

306
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:51,539
Look, you-You are a...

307
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,544
Jesse, look at me.

308
00:24:57,211 --> 00:25:00,339
You are a blowfish.

309
00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:02,758
What?
-A blowfish. Think about it.

310
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:07,096
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

311
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,597
Easy prey for predators...

312
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,100
...but the blowfish
has a secret weapon...

313
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:13,644
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

314
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:17,773
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

315
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,611
I don't even know-
-The blowfish puffs up.

316
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,657
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

317
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,452
And why? Why does he do that?

318
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,330
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

319
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:33,539
Intimidating.

320
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:36,959
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

321
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,920
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

322
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,090
You see, it's just all an illusion.

323
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,302
You see, it's nothing but air.

324
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,305
Now...

325
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:52,641
...who messes with the blowfish,
Jesse?

326
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,270
Nobody.
-You're damn right.

327
00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:00,524
I'm a blowfish.
-You are a blowfish.

328
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,234
Say it again.
-I'm a blowfish.

329
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:04,320
Say it like you mean it.
-I'm a blowfish.

330
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,406
You're a blowfish. That's right.
-Yeah!

331
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:10,493
Blowfishing this up.

332
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,532
Hello?

333
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,660
<i>The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?</i>

334
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,834
Vanco...

335
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:03,587
...new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

336
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:08,467
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

337
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:11,971
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

338
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:15,683
You know what? I'll teach you.

339
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:22,732
It means, "Let's make a deal."

340
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,234
So go ahead. We're waiting.

341
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,529
Okay.

342
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:32,074
Right here.

343
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,994
"Item SS4G:

344
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:39,749
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball...

345
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:41,751
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

346
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,545
Vanco, write this down.

347
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,131
Oh, man, watch out.

348
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:52,595
"66100ZBG: large-size floor runner."

349
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:56,015
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor...

350
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:59,101
...except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

351
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,564
<i>I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my casa.</i>

352
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:04,940
We'll get you three.

353
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,193
No, you give me 10.
-Five.

354
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,573
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

355
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:19,914
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

356
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,626
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

357
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,629
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

358
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:27,880
Schrader...

359
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:34,553
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

360
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:39,225
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

361
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:44,021
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

362
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:51,153
I take my time, but I always win.

363
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,409
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

364
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,120
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

365
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:03,249
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

366
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:06,544
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

367
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,421
Definitely two of those, huh?

368
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:12,174
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

369
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,053
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

370
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,806
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

371
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:22,101
So you gonna go down to EI Paso?

372
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,770
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

373
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:26,564
They keep him busy every second.

374
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:28,774
He's already got some
big operation going.

375
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,360
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

376
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,904
...except it's on the other side
of the border.

377
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,698
Wow, that sounds exciting.

378
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,451
He's being safe, right?

379
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,745
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

380
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,956
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

381
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:47,543
Speaking of riding desks...

382
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:49,712
...got myself a job today.

383
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:52,548
You did not.

384
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:57,845
As big as you are?

385
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,559
Thank you.
-You know I just mean...

386
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,394
Where? With who?

387
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:09,315
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

388
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:10,524
Beneke.

389
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:14,403
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

390
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,739
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

391
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:21,911
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

392
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,456
Just what you want in an executive.
-And he apologised profusely.

393
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:29,251
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

394
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,171
It will not happen again.

395
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:36,717
Is money that tight?

396
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,263
Yeah.

397
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:44,475
You know we can always help out.

398
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,144
No, Marie.

399
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:49,021
You know Walt. He would just...

400
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,861
Speak of the devil.
-Hey. Hi, Marie.

401
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,780
How are you? What's up?

402
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:00,741
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

403
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,618
Good. Good.
-Hi, honey.

404
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,454
Dinner will be about an hour and-
-Oh, thanks, sweetie.

405
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,333
Everything okay?
-Everything's perfect.

406
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,317
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

407
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,528
So? Same thing.

408
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,280
Not the same thing.

409
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:42,283
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

410
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:46,746
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

411
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:52,043
It's-It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

412
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,461
You're pushing it.

413
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,422
Morning.
-Morning, honey.

414
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,674
Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

415
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,969
Dad, notice anything?

416
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:05,639
Is there a funeral today?

417
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:06,849
A funeral?
-Well-

418
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,185
Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
-No, no, no.

419
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:11,479
Mom got a job.

420
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,105
A job? Why?

421
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,858
Well, do I need to get out
the chequebook and show you?

422
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,195
No, I... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

423
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:22,114
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labour.

424
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:25,701
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

425
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,579
Where?

426
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,998
Beneke.

427
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,793
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

428
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,672
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit...

429
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,883
...in the first place?
-They've gone green since then.

430
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,762
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

431
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,723
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

432
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,811
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

433
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,145
Yeah.

434
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:54,397
Who's running things?

435
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,857
Ted. The son.

436
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:02,405
Anyway, I have got to go.

437
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,200
I don't wanna be late
my first day back.

438
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,160
Bye-bye.
-Bye.

439
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,162
Bye.
-Bye.

440
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:11,789
Okay.

441
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:15,376
Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

442
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:19,755
Bye.

443
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,144
Hey.

444
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,731
You left your cave.

445
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:38,941
Yeah.

446
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,777
I was-I'm missing my TV.

447
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,362
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

448
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:46,115
You know,
snag a big-ass wide-screen.

449
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:48,576
So...

450
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,494
Yeah.

451
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,830
What you drawing?

452
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,751
Damn.

453
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,336
That's good.

454
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:00,212
Make a hell of a tat.

455
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:01,547
That's the plan.

456
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:02,923
Really?

457
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:05,968
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.

458
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,261
Right on.

459
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:11,974
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

460
00:34:12,558 --> 00:34:14,769
I used to do a little of that.

461
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:19,357
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

462
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:23,986
What stopped you?

463
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,325
You know, just...

464
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,452
So tell me something.

465
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:36,040
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

466
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,169
That's way too big a commitment.

467
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:52,598
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

468
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,186
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

469
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,854
Yeah.

470
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,440
Right on, man. Keep it real.

471
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,074
"Pinkman," huh?

472
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,701
Yeah.

473
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,161
I thought your name was "Jackson."

474
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,555
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

475
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:34,015
Are we...?

476
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:35,725
Are we just on mañana time?

477
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,268
They'll show.

478
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:40,229
Yeah? Why is that?

479
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:43,357
You got more catalogues
for him to clean out?

480
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:47,236
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

481
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:53,159
What the hell are they thinking?

482
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,870
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

483
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,289
Politics, man. Politics.

484
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:05,254
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

485
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,760
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.

486
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:14,722
Hey, something
I need to know about?

487
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,308
What? Oh, that? No, man.

488
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:20,478
We were just singing your praises.

489
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,979
Glad to have you.

490
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:23,939
Welcome aboard.

491
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,045
Hey, is that your guy?

492
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,882
Hey, I think that's your guy.

493
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,302
What the hell
is he doing down there?

494
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:01,954
Schrader, where you going?

495
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:06,876
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

496
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,047
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw...

497
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,549
...a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

498
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,563
Hey, welcome to-

499
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,715
My leg.

500
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:18,489
<i>-headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.</i>

501
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:21,117
The game has changed, yo.

502
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,120
This is our city, all right?

503
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,872
All of it. The whole damn place.

504
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,125
Our territory.

505
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,127
We're staking our claim...

506
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:35,089
...that we sell when we want,
where we want.

507
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:38,050
Now, we're gonna be kings,
understand?

508
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,802
Well, I'm gonna be king.

509
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,471
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

510
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,307
I wanna be a knight.
-But first things first.

511
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,601
We gotta get more dealers.

512
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,312
You know, foot soldiers, right?

513
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,314
Now, they'll be working for you.

514
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,609
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

515
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,903
You follow me?

516
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,905
Layered, like nachos.

517
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:01,824
Exponential growth.

518
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,619
Now, that's success
with a capital S.

519
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:07,371
Straight up, straight up.

520
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,581
For shizzle.

521
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:09,832
Frigging awesome.

522
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,387
Well, we're set.

523
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:27,099
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

524
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,393
Cheddar, Mr. White.

525
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:33,814
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

526
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,109
Gonna own this city.

527
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,362
We're not charging enough.

528
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:41,989
What?

529
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:45,326
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

530
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:48,162
Simple economics.

531
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:11,060
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

532
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,188
Looks like they got you all set up.
-Yeah. It's perfect.

533
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:17,400
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

534
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,609
And that's very nice.

535
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:21,070
I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
-Yeah.

536
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,990
Listen, I...

537
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,202
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

538
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,247
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

539
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:38,587
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

540
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,423
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

541
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,925
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

542
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,593
Hey, how is Denise doing?

543
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,596
We split up, about a year ago.

544
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:51,100
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,645
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

546
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:57,440
Together since high school.
-Yeah.

547
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,608
I remember that.
-Anyway...

548
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,695
I don't know, people change.

549
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:03,988
Yes.

550
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:06,782
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

551
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,493
Welcome you back. And...

552
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:12,204
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

553
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:13,914
Okay.

554
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,003
We should have lunch one day.

555
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:20,463
Like old times.

556
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,798
Sure.

557
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:57,226
Oh, hey.

558
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,770
Hey, yourself.

559
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,736
So listen. My...

560
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,989
My name is not really
Jesse Jackson.

561
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,827
It's Jesse Pinkman.

562
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,913
And that guy you met...

563
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:22,835
...he's not my dad.

564
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:35,556
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

565
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:38,601
Because I actually really like it here.

566
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,897
I don't make it my business
what you do.

567
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,025
So long as you don't do it here.

568
00:44:52,615 --> 00:44:56,577
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

569
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,083
Wanna see?

570
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,821
It's got that thing where the blacks...

571
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,158
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

572
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:41,706
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

573
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:46,043
So it'll really rock the house.

574
00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:48,713
But I'll, you know...

575
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:54,176
I'll keep it way down, of course.

576
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,356
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

577
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,529
Come on, come on.
