1
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,228
Okay. That's okay.

2
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:28,825
Get that.

3
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:32,371
Hey.

4
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,530
Oh, God. Please.
-Oh, jeez.

5
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,157
Please.

6
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:51,658
Please.

7
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,835
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:03,837
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:06,298
Yeah.

10
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,841
Yeah.

11
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:31,925
You see that?

12
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:05,083
What does he remember?
-Not a whole lot.

13
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,127
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...

14
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:10,047
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilised pretty quickly.

15
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:11,381
But I mean...

16
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,968
He knows where he is?
-Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

17
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:18,514
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,308
Go on in. He's probably awake.

19
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:28,982
My God.

20
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,235
Walter.

21
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:35,072
I'm so sorry.

22
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:43,997
Come here.

23
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:46,500
You know who I am, right?

24
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,835
Yes, son. I know who you are.

25
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,880
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

26
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,011
It's so good to see you.

27
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,099
How do you feel?

28
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,813
Better.

29
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,857
Yeah. I...

30
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,317
I feel like myself.

31
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,528
Really, I mean, in...

32
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:19,825
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

33
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,076
...I feel fine.

34
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,287
My God, Walt.

35
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,875
What a day this has been.

36
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,211
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

37
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:33,547
A shootout?

38
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,717
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

39
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:37,926
Uncle Hank wasted him.

40
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:40,804
Oh, my God. Is he all right?
-Absolutely fine.

41
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:44,808
Where did this happen? How could-?
-Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,437
We're all okay.

43
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:50,314
We'll be all right.

44
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:53,150
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

45
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,568
No.

46
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,738
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

47
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:01,909
<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

48
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,244
I really...

49
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,999
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

50
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,709
Well, which supermarket?

51
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,962
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

52
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:16,882
<i>-Marie.
-I... Don't get me wrong.</i>

53
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,095
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:24,097
I just, I mean...

55
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,935
He... Naked?

56
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,938
He was naked.

57
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:32,898
Naked.

58
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:34,691
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,276
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,821
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

61
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,075
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

62
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,701
How's Hank?

63
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,454
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

64
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:50,958
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,002
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

66
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:57,339
...they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:00,759
But how is he? Really?

68
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:04,471
Hank?

69
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,852
He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:15,440
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,318
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

72
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,822
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,617
He was shot previous to your arrival?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:29,454
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

75
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,832
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

76
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,586
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

77
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,838
I returned fire and sought cover...

78
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,091
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

79
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:44,970
When he paused to reload...

80
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,556
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

81
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,143
Agent Schrader...

82
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,771
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

83
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,691
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

84
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,485
I was tending to another matter.
-What other matter?

85
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,617
An unrelated family matter.

86
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,870
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

87
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:13,582
Your brother-in-law?
-Yes, sir. He's since been found.

88
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,543
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

89
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:18,670
At the time, he'd been missing
for hours...

90
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,382
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

91
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,510
I was talking to his acquaintances...

92
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:26,970
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

93
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:30,766
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

94
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:34,102
...a Jesse Pinkman.

95
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:38,899
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

96
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:42,361
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

97
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:46,281
Have you run him down yet?
-Not yet, but we're working on it.

98
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:00,587
Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

99
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,214
They don't give up.

100
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,676
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

101
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,179
They need probable cause.
-Probable cause?

102
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,181
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

103
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,768
I told you, this is serious shit.

104
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:17,020
I'm like an outlaw.

105
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,397
Okay.

106
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,366
Let's do this.

107
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:42,796
Holy Christ!

108
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:45,465
You're Willy Wonka.

109
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:48,427
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

110
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,722
Put me on your magical boat, man.

111
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,058
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

112
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,602
So where you keep the pseudo?

113
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,564
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

114
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:04,443
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

115
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,403
No pseudo?

116
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:10,824
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

117
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,745
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

118
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:18,665
But I can't just let you
break this down.

119
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:21,502
That'd be sacrilege.
-I told you, that's why we're here.

120
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,337
You saw the cops. Right?
-Sure.

121
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:25,881
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

122
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,842
You know, for the road?
-No, forget it, all right?

123
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:32,888
This stuff has to go, like, now.
-Dude, you owe me.

124
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,768
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

125
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,561
God, Badger!

126
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:44,399
Don't mess with me.

127
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:47,027
Got it?

128
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:52,658
Yeah, I got it.

129
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,969
Oh, my God.

130
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:17,558
Okay, that's all of it.

131
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:20,435
This was a bad choice.

132
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:27,609
You sure about this guy?

133
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,987
He's totally, totally cool.

134
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:31,947
He's my cousin.

135
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:39,580
Yo, what'd we say, 500?
-We didn't say, and it's 1000.

136
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:41,164
Thousand bucks?

137
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,042
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

138
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,044
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

139
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,924
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

140
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,014
...560.

141
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,308
You know what?
-Hey-No-

142
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,394
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

143
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:06,106
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

144
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:10,485
That right? You a stand-up dude?
-Yeah, I am.

145
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,905
I will get you the other 500.

146
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,281
Five hundred more.

147
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,743
Your word's your bond, right?

148
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,786
Right.

149
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:30,047
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

150
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:33,300
What are you doing now, exactly?

151
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,385
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

152
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:39,056
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

153
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,807
You're not using your own name.

154
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:45,812
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

155
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:48,065
Why do you gotta go and do this?

156
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,943
They need probable cause.

157
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:52,486
I'm giving it to them.

158
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:07,751
What's the last thing
you remember?

159
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:12,506
Well, I was driving home.

160
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:14,341
I think.

161
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:16,969
And...

162
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:19,429
Do you remember coming home?

163
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,766
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

164
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,523
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

165
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,150
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

166
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:37,698
Nothing else? No fleeting images?
-Well, no. I...

167
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,242
I was-

168
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:47,040
I was walking down some road
or highway...

169
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,419
...with a lot of headlights...

170
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:54,756
...and I remember feeling fear.

171
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,011
That's it.
-All right. Thank you.

172
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:02,222
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

173
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,933
The MRI shows no metastases.

174
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,020
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

175
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,063
Yeah, we're looking really good.

176
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:12,024
Oh, thank God.

177
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,944
So, what was it, then?

178
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:19,531
There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
-And considering your condition...

179
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,408
...the blood panel looks good.

180
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:24,745
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

181
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,207
As of right now, we really...

182
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:29,791
...can't say.

183
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,420
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field...

184
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,256
...but isn't it possible
that this had something to do...

185
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:38,592
...with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

186
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,344
There's the antiemetic...

187
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:42,387
...the antitussive...

188
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:46,099
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

189
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:52,648
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

190
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:54,733
...I'm feeling much better.

191
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,528
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

192
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,239
...the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

193
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:04,451
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

194
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,871
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

195
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,792
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

196
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,878
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

197
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:17,089
Stressed out? I-

198
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,299
No, I don't think I'm-
-Walt, please.

199
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:21,802
Stressed out is putting it...

200
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,262
...mildly.

201
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:31,061
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

202
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,938
...I'm feeling much better.

203
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,816
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

204
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:38,944
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

205
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,697
A ways down the road?

206
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:46,076
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

207
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:51,498
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

208
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:54,042
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

209
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,503
But until we know
what caused this incident...

210
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,089
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

211
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:46,053
That your last hit?
-Yeah.

212
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,555
Finish it quick.

213
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,382
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

214
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,594
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

215
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,644
I'm going, I'm going.

216
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:37,646
What's going on?

217
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,857
What did I do?

218
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,778
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

219
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,135
What, man?
-Tell me again.

220
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,429
Again?

221
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:13,473
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

222
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,643
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

223
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:20,189
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

224
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:21,773
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

225
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:24,568
...and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

226
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,403
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

227
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:27,863
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:30,365
You order take-out?
-Yeah.

229
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:32,576
Yeah, where from?

230
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:35,412
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan...

231
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,748
...from that chink place
around the corner?

232
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:41,668
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

233
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,504
You know, Funyuns.

234
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,172
I had a Hot Pocket.

235
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,883
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

236
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:49,718
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

237
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,471
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

238
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,765
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

239
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:57,017
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

240
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,187
You weren't answering your phone.
-It was in my car.

241
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,190
That right?
-Yeah.

242
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:07,236
We found your car...

243
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:09,571
...but your phone wasn't in it.

244
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,281
You found my car?

245
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:13,534
You found my car?

246
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:17,079
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

247
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,876
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

248
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,712
Did you leave anything else
in the car?

249
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,047
Like what?

250
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,676
Like what? Like...

251
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:33,220
I don't know. Like this?

252
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:46,567
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

253
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,402
That's not mine.

254
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,404
That's not yours?

255
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,407
He says it's not his, Gomie.

256
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,951
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

257
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,746
I wish.
-Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

258
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,040
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

259
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:05,127
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

260
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,838
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

261
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:09,715
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

262
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:12,342
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

263
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,888
So who's your chief, little Injun?

264
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,598
What?

265
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,809
What does that even mean?
-I think your story's bullshit.

266
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,478
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

267
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,606
Your car was there
because you were there.

268
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:30,110
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

269
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:33,197
So, what are you saying?

270
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,324
I shot someone?

271
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,994
With, like, a gun?
-You?

272
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,079
No.

273
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:44,374
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

274
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,711
But I think you know
the badass who did.

275
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:53,383
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

276
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,845
Funyuns and boom-boom.

277
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,097
No.

278
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:01,141
I don't think so.

279
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,478
Tell you what. We're gonna...

280
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:08,690
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

281
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,567
And you know what?

282
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:16,615
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

283
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,120
Don't go nowhere.

284
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:39,930
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

285
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:43,183
I got medical issues.
-Medical issues?

286
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:45,352
Like, what kind of medical issues?

287
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:47,229
You got penis withdrawal?

288
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:49,773
You got schlongus interruptus?

289
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:53,026
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

290
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:55,070
...and you get a root beer
and a tinkle.

291
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,239
Tell me the last three days.
-I told you...

292
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,992
...we were shacked up
since Saturday.

293
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,412
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

294
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:07,124
Not even for a second?

295
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:11,461
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

296
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,422
Maybe?

297
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,382
Did Jesse leave the room?

298
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,302
He did, didn't he?

299
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:21,889
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

300
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:25,350
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

301
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:29,188
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

302
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:33,358
It's you. I know you.

303
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,904
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

304
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:38,864
What?
-The kid with the crutches.

305
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:41,366
The football player.
-How about we stay on topic?

306
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:45,662
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

307
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:48,665
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

308
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:50,584
And that's all I'm saying about that.

309
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:52,377
Now, come on.

310
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,755
Where's my root beer?

311
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,385
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

312
00:23:00,594 --> 00:23:02,095
It's a long story, Gomie.

313
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:05,807
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

314
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:09,186
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

315
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:18,487
And how are you sleeping?

316
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,368
Fine. Most nights.

317
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:25,869
Good.

318
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:28,455
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

319
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:30,791
...things you can't
get out of your head?

320
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,465
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

321
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:42,469
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

322
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:45,639
...but where is this going, exactly?

323
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:49,226
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

324
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:53,146
Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
-Ongoing for how long?

325
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:54,648
I just met you. Hard to say.

326
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:57,860
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

327
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:03,156
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

328
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:04,658
Now...

329
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:10,164
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

330
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:13,000
Walt...

331
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,753
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

332
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:19,089
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

333
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:20,382
Get into a situation...

334
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,509
...where you could be shot
by the police?

335
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,386
We can't allow you to leave...

336
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:27,681
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

337
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,642
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

338
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,484
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

339
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:40,861
It's very straightforward.

340
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:44,448
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

341
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:45,949
What about my family?

342
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:49,494
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

343
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:52,331
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

344
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:56,210
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

345
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,047
And you, as a medical practitioner...

346
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:02,424
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

347
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:03,967
Yes.

348
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:11,433
All right.

349
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:16,188
There was no fugue state.

350
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,108
I remember everything.

351
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,782
The truth is...

352
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,619
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

353
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:34,248
I just had to get out...

354
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:36,124
...and so I left.

355
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,502
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

356
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,092
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

357
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:48,762
I got as far as Gallup...

358
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:55,310
...and then it was just time
to come home.

359
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,104
So...

360
00:25:57,312 --> 00:26:00,148
...being found naked
in a supermarket...

361
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,902
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

362
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:07,322
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

363
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:16,707
Why run away?

364
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:19,960
What did you feel
you had to run from?

365
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:28,093
Doctor, my wife
is seven months pregnant...

366
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:30,304
...with a baby we didn't intend.

367
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:34,975
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

368
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:39,521
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

369
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,526
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

370
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,778
I have watched
all of my colleagues...

371
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,364
...and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable...

372
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:53,452
...and within 18 months,
I will be dead.

373
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,081
And you ask why I ran?

374
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:33,742
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?

375
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:45,003
What's that mean?
-That means yes.

376
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:49,216
Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
-Come on, this is bullshit.

377
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:53,053
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

378
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:54,721
Señor...

379
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:57,057
...are we on the planet Mars?

380
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,729
Are we on the planet Saturn?

381
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,775
Are we on the planet Earth?

382
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:12,573
Señor, is today Friday?

383
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:14,408
Is today Monday?

384
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:17,161
Is today Tuesday?

385
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,497
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

386
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,834
Señor...

387
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,255
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

388
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:40,350
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

389
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:51,111
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

390
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,572
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

391
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:59,453
Señor, are you scared of this man?

392
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:03,457
No, he's not scared.

393
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:09,421
Come on, Granddad.

394
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,882
Don't you wanna help us out?

395
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:31,318
Oh, man.

396
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:40,327
I guess that's a no.

397
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:45,332
I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

398
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:47,668
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

399
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:50,921
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

400
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:55,175
All right. It was worth a try at least.
-We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

401
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:57,302
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

402
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,596
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

403
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:03,100
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

404
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:05,394
...with shooting Tuco, man.

405
00:30:07,229 --> 00:30:09,857
Dad? Hey, Dad.

406
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,859
Hey, can you hear me?

407
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,737
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

408
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,240
What's-?

409
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,410
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

410
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:23,370
You know, I actually...

411
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:26,331
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

412
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,749
I've been busy as...

413
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,835
As totally productive.

414
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:33,338
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

415
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:36,842
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

416
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,511
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

417
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,055
Hey, could you give me a ride?

418
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:46,685
I'm actually-
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

419
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:51,481
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will-

420
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,402
I'll call you later
when you have some...

421
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:58,155
Okay. Yeah. No. I-

422
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:00,991
I get it. I get it.

423
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,577
Okay, bye.

424
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,880
Thanks.

425
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,841
So, what are you doing now?

426
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,010
Waffle House?

427
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:23,430
Waffle House is good.

428
00:31:58,131 --> 00:31:59,132
Pay phone?

429
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:02,010
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

430
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:03,220
So how did it go?

431
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,640
Okay. You?

432
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:11,144
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

433
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:13,689
So you getting out of there?
-Tomorrow.

434
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,899
So who came for you?

435
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,860
The DEA? What did they ask you?

436
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:21,530
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

437
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,282
...took my rainy-day fund.

438
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,284
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

439
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:28,745
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

440
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,873
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

441
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:33,000
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

442
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,585
Wait, wait. What does he know?

443
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:36,378
Does he know it's your money?

444
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,089
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

445
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,841
The plan worked.

446
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,259
They bought it.

447
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,928
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

448
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:49,266
<i>-Did he mention my name?
-No. Thanks for caring.</i>

449
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:54,354
What about the basement?
-It's clean.

450
00:32:54,563 --> 00:32:56,523
<i>And the RV?</i>

451
00:32:56,732 --> 00:33:00,569
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

452
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:03,113
Can he get it running again?

453
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:06,950
<i>-Why?
-So we can cook.</i>

454
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,912
So you still wanna cook?

455
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,580
Seriously?

456
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,542
What's changed, Jesse?

457
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:27,554
Seven-hundred
thirty-seven thousand.

458
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:29,723
Twenty-one pounds...

459
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:32,267
...minus cash on hand...

460
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,228
Cash on hand.

461
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:14,388
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
-No, I was awake.

462
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:19,726
Want some cornflakes?
-Yeah, sure.

463
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:28,151
You okay?
-Yeah.

464
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:31,733
Southwest Aniline again?

465
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:34,194
What's this?

466
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:36,738
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

467
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:40,409
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

468
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,953
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

469
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,497
P2P, huh?

470
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,249
So, what are you thinking?

471
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:49,334
The two stooges over here
cooked it?

472
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:53,505
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

473
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,215
At least since this.

474
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:58,051
Krazy-8.
-Yeah.

475
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:02,264
Krazy-8, Tuco...

476
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:06,185
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

477
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,229
A simple explanation...

478
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:11,982
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

479
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,735
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

480
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:17,237
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

481
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,364
It's 11 in the morning.

482
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:20,574
I'm buying.

483
00:39:20,782 --> 00:39:22,034
You're buying? Holy crap.

484
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:25,078
What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
-Oh, yeah.

485
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:30,918
Surprise.

486
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:34,838
You little sneaky bastard, you.

487
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:36,673
Very nice work.

488
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:38,926
Thank you, sir.

489
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:43,514
What's this?
-Look what we got you.

490
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:46,850
Look at that, I love it.
-They got the gut right.

491
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,102
Hey.
-There you go.

492
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:50,938
Hey, thanks, man.
-Thank you.

493
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:56,944
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

494
00:39:57,152 --> 00:39:59,112
You shouldn't have.

495
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:03,450
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

496
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:05,369
I love it.

497
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,459
You going to finish
your apple juice?

498
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:15,462
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

499
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:19,049
You're supposed to drink it.

500
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:22,678
The nurse said
you have to stay hydrated.

501
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:24,930
But I'm not thirsty.

502
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:28,392
Dad. Drink it.

503
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,321
Hey.

504
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,282
Better late than never, huh?

505
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,409
Hey.
-Hey.

506
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:48,245
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

507
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:50,497
I see
the mark of the beast there, huh?

508
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:52,875
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

509
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,961
They really cheer the place up.

510
00:40:57,546 --> 00:41:00,174
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

511
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:03,844
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

512
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:07,139
So tell us about the shootout.

513
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:10,684
I was, you know, just doing my job.

514
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:13,353
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

515
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:15,480
Say, Walt, you know...

516
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:18,400
...how are you?

517
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,360
I'm okay.

518
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:23,155
Really, I'm feeling fine.

519
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,657
Yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:28,702
The doctor is calling it a...

521
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:32,956
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

522
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,708
Damn.

523
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:36,543
Which means non-recurring.

524
00:41:36,752 --> 00:41:38,921
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

525
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,547
Sounds real good.

526
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:44,384
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

527
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:47,429
Listen, Hank.

528
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:49,973
I don't know what to say. I mean...

529
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:56,104
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

530
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,983
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

531
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,778
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

532
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:06,406
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

533
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:09,910
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

534
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:12,120
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

535
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,499
You ought to disappear more often.

536
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:18,085
Just kidding. Don't do that.

537
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,963
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

538
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,756
Look what they gave me.

539
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:24,216
What is it?

540
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:28,887
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

541
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,306
His grill?
-Yeah.

542
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,101
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

543
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:36,603
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

544
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:39,439
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

545
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:41,441
Wow, cool.

546
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,651
Yeah.

547
00:43:08,677 --> 00:43:11,430
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

548
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:20,564
I'll get these in the wash.

549
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:22,107
Okay.

550
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:00,896
Say, honey, I...

551
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:06,068
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

552
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:15,786
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

553
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:29,967
Skyler, listen to me.

554
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:35,556
This will not happen again, okay?

555
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:36,890
I won't let it.

556
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,602
I'm still here. I'm me...

557
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:44,189
...and we're gonna be okay.

558
00:44:50,112 --> 00:44:51,780
Walt...

559
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:56,618
...do you have a second cell phone?

560
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:01,456
A second cell phone?

561
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,878
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

562
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:08,172
...and you were very upset.

563
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,925
It was like something
terrible had happened.

564
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:14,970
And then your cell phone rang.

565
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,432
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

566
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,101
...and just disappeared.

567
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,313
Yeah.

568
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,815
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

569
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,027
...there was no call.

570
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:33,947
No call on the phone I know about.

571
00:45:38,827 --> 00:45:40,454
That is...

572
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:42,372
...odd.

573
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:45,542
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

574
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:50,714
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

575
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,010
Okay.
