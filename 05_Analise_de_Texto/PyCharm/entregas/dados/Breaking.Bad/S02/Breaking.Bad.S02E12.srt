1
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,582
Skyler, I'm so....

2
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,586
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

3
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:46,340
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,801
Is she beautiful?

5
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:56,601
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

6
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,394
Some accident up ahead.

7
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,522
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

8
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:06,694
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

9
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:08,779
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:25,630
Excuse me. Skyler White?

11
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:28,299
-307.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:42,104
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just....

13
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,981
Are you okay?

14
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,487
Meet your daughter.

15
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:04,001
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

16
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,170
Congratulations, Walt.

17
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:12,176
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

18
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:14,971
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:19,725
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

20
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,478
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

21
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,522
...and deliver her himself.

22
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:30,695
Well, that--
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

23
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:32,780
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,324
No problem at all.

25
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,327
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can--

26
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:41,497
You three can be alone, okay?

27
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,333
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

28
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,212
-I really can't begin to thank you.
-Don't think anything of it.

29
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,381
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

30
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,008
-Thank you.
-She's beautiful.

31
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:53,718
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

32
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,219
Okay. Take care.

33
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:56,679
Bye.

34
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,732
Are you okay?

35
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,775
-Is everything okay?
-Everything is okay.

36
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:13,404
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,577
-Where's everyone else?
-Downstairs.

38
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,454
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

39
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:25,875
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

40
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,002
-No.
-Yeah.

41
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,589
Did he?

42
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,510
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,055
-Anything at all?
-Actually, yes.

44
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,849
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

45
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,769
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

46
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:48,773
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

47
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,317
Doing it natural instead.

48
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,778
It just couldn't have gone any better.

49
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,488
Good.

50
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:02,954
Let me go get your things.

51
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:07,542
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

52
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,293
-I'll spend the night.
-Okay.

53
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,640
Dad.

54
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:48,476
I was in the shower, hey.

55
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,562
I overslept.

56
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,524
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

57
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,276
Yeah.

58
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:04,659
Baby, I gotta go.

59
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:08,162
Okay.

60
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,512
Somebody broke in.

61
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,305
Okay.

62
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,283
Oh, no. No, no, no!

63
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:47,827
Come on.

64
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:49,912
Damn.

65
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,333
Oh, God.

66
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:57,628
Oh, Christ.

67
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,926
This week was tough.

68
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:05,553
Toughest yet.

69
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:08,931
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

70
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,517
-My birthday.
-Your re-birthday?

71
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:13,728
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:15,771
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

73
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,398
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,942
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:22,111
I know my boss was pissed.

76
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,323
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,657
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,784
All it would take is one friend...

79
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:31,662
...and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

80
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:33,998
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:37,168
I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:01,859
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:05,154
-You getting enough sleep?
-Actually, no.

84
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:08,866
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:11,535
-Yeah?
-A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:14,330
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:18,000
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,211
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,381
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:27,802
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,471
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,557
You need to avoid
those type of people.

93
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:35,726
I know and I do.

94
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,189
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,233
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,319
Thank you.

97
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,159
So how's your job?

98
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:54,245
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

99
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,747
Doing backup training
on my days off.

100
00:08:56,956 --> 00:09:00,751
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

101
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,342
You seeing anyone?

102
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:12,013
No.

103
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,389
You?

104
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,183
What about that guy next door?

105
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,727
What do you mean?

106
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,271
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

107
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,064
...of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,358
He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:26,193
Yeah.

110
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,737
Dad, he's our tenant.

111
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:29,780
End of story.

112
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,908
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

113
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,036
Okay.

114
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,788
There you go.

115
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,133
Oh, yes.

116
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,427
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

117
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,138
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

118
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:56,724
Yeah. And why not?

119
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,684
Good stock.

120
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:03,147
I'll get it.

121
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:04,649
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:07,652
Hello. Hello?

123
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,030
Nobody's there.

124
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,823
Oh, well.

125
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,619
Beat you.

126
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,163
-Hello.
-Hey, man.

127
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:20,831
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

128
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:22,583
Just Carmen.

129
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:26,420
-Come on. Hurry up.
-So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

130
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,006
<i>Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,592
Well, Holly.

132
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,636
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

133
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:36,389
Everybody is doing just fine.

134
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:39,350
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

135
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,686
I am trying to tell you, man.

136
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:44,814
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

137
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:46,482
<i>-I got robbed.
-What?</i>

138
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:51,195
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

139
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:53,114
All of it.

140
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,326
You get me, Mr. White?

141
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,620
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>

142
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,039
They knew exactly where to look.

143
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:05,877
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

144
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,379
<i>Mr. White.</i>

145
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,008
God!

146
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,677
Oh, no.

147
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:20,892
Okay. Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:30,192
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

149
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:32,445
All right. I just had to get a beer.

150
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,196
Finally.

151
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:35,990
All right, guys. Here we go.

152
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:39,994
<i>We got mild, medium
and muy caliente.</i>

153
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,413
I got dibs on the breast.

154
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:45,750
-Los Pollos Hermanos?
-Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

155
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,253
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

156
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,505
That baby is hungry.

157
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,090
Give me that baby.

158
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,426
Oh, sweetie, yes.

159
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,261
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

160
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,096
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

161
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:03,601
-Not at the table. We're eating.
-Hank, it's only a breast.

162
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,896
-It's my sister-in-law's breast.
-Oh, you are so provincial.

163
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,523
Hank, remember the day...

164
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,026
...when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

165
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:13,277
Yeah.

166
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,947
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

167
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,909
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

168
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:24,080
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would--

169
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,499
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

170
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:27,708
Oh, nice.

171
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,753
-Wow, that sounds expensive.
-Well, yeah.

172
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:35,633
-But for the baby, I mean....
-Well, why don't....

173
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,803
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

174
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,430
-Absolutely.
-No, no. Thank you.

175
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,141
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

176
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,018
We'll take care of it.

177
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:48,104
Back at work soon?

178
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,856
Since you're scheduled
for surgery...

179
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:55,319
...I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:56,946 --> 00:13:02,034
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:06,330
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years....

182
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:11,586
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

183
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:15,423
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

184
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:16,674
I wish.

185
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,885
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

186
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:22,680
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:26,142
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,443
I'll get her.

189
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,695
I'll get her.

190
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:49,540
Yes. Good girl.

191
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:52,084
That's a good girl.

192
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,545
My little girl, huh?

193
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,977
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,855
Come here.

195
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,858
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:21,906
Yeah.

197
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:30,081
Hey.

198
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:33,918
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

199
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:37,922
Let me show you.

200
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,967
Here. Come here.

201
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,054
Wanna see?

202
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:02,321
That's right. Daddy did that.

203
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:10,663
Daddy did that for you.

204
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,635
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:28,180
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,891
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:32,101
-Get out.
-No. You took the stash.

208
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,270
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

209
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:37,440
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:41,402
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

211
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:45,156
-...and you were the one who took it!
-Shut up.

212
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:47,992
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:54,832
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,794
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:01,505
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:04,926
What was that, heroin?

217
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:07,970
Jesus.

218
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:10,848
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off--

219
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,351
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

220
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,645
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

221
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:19,232
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,527
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,240
Son of a bitch.

224
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,452
How much?

225
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:36,415
-How much what?
-How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,004
One-point-two million.

227
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,632
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,634
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,387
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:53,266
All right.
So where's my money?

231
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,977
What?

232
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:00,064
You are joking, right?

233
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:04,151
If I gave you that money...

234
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,529
...you would be dead
inside of a week.

235
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:11,325
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

236
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:14,912
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

237
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,039
And the.... And the meth.

238
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:20,585
You know, I could take it or leave it.

239
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:23,379
I'm clean, Mr. White.

240
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,172
For real.

241
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,604
Prove it. Pee in that.

242
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,648
-How gay are you, seriously?
-Pee in it.

243
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:45,192
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

244
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:48,738
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

245
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:51,240
No, huh?

246
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,952
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

247
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:58,122
...on the kindness of strangers
to get high.

248
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:01,125
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

249
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:30,488
Not on her tummy, Walt.

250
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:33,449
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

251
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:36,285
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

252
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,246
-Yeah.
-Right there.

253
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,957
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up...

254
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:45,920
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

255
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:49,215
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

256
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,842
-It's hypoallergenic.
-Oh, yeah?

257
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:54,345
Well, I think a towel will do.

258
00:18:58,307 --> 00:18:59,934
Skyler, what is it?

259
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:05,189
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

260
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:14,615
-I told you it's not ready yet.
-Honey, just show it to them.

261
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,596
My God, son. That's wonderful.

262
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:38,222
Flynn.

263
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,808
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:44,395
SaveWalterWhite.com.

265
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,815
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

266
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:53,321
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

267
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,489
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

268
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:58,826
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

269
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,830
-See?
-But we can't ask for money.

270
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:05,958
Walt.

271
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,128
Okay.

272
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:13,382
I appreciate it. I really do.

273
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,093
Show me what else you put on.

274
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:22,225
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

275
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,435
-Just let him help.
-Skyler.

276
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:28,522
It's-- You can't ask him
to take it down.

277
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:32,652
-It'll crush him.
-Skyler, it's charity.

278
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:39,951
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

279
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:51,629
This is insane.

280
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:53,965
I have so much cash on hand...

281
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:57,051
...that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

282
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,638
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

283
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:03,683
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

284
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:05,393
I mean, it's--

285
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,228
It's insane.

286
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,481
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

287
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:12,275
What?

288
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:13,985
Gun molls.

289
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:16,153
<i>Haven't you ever seen White Heat?</i>

290
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:18,823
<i>Yeah, I've seen White Heat...</i>

291
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:21,951
-...but I don't see how that pertains.
-Maybe you need a moll...

292
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,829
...more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

293
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:26,581
-Just--
-What good is money...

294
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,333
...that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest....

295
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:33,087
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

296
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,673
Out.

297
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:37,258
Let's see. What else is there?

298
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:39,760
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

299
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:41,721
...down by the railroad tracks."

300
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,473
No? No? Works for me.

301
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,475
Uncle Murray.

302
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:48,769
Oh, yeah.

303
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,480
Yeah,
"Oh, many is the happy memory...

304
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,608
...of Uncle Murray
bouncing me on his knee.

305
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:56,485
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago...

306
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:59,906
-...but he kicked it, left me millions."
-No, no.

307
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:05,369
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

308
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:08,122
No, I earned that money, me.

309
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:10,833
And now my son created
his own website...

310
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:15,046
...SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

311
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:18,925
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

312
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:26,224
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

313
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,727
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

314
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:33,064
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

315
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:35,858
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

316
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:39,237
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

317
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,240
-Do I have to spell it out for you?
-I know. I know.

318
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,742
You're thinking that I should be
funnelling money...

319
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,078
...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

320
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:49,914
I am not going to have
my family think that some...

321
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:52,291
...mystery benefactor saved us.

322
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,461
Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

323
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,005
That would raise too many questions.
However--

324
00:22:58,214 --> 00:23:00,258
Stay with me here.

325
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,009
--zombies.

326
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:07,014
<i>I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this Rain Man-type.</i>

327
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:10,601
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

328
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,729
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

329
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:17,358
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

330
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:20,194
This guy can hijack
random desktops...

331
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:24,073
...all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

332
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:28,744
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000...

333
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:32,290
...little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

334
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,542
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...

335
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,004
...all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable...

336
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:42,133
...from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...

337
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,468
...cancer saint.

338
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:48,347
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

339
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:56,814
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

340
00:23:57,857 --> 00:23:59,317
Not too much.

341
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,986
I mean, like, who is he, right?

342
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:04,906
I mean, first off, I taught him.

343
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:08,159
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

344
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,755
Now the cotton.

345
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:27,678
Needle?

346
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:33,017
-I don't understand why you need him.
-Exactly.

347
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:37,855
My point exactly.

348
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:50,368
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

349
00:24:55,122 --> 00:24:57,333
How much does he owe you,
anyway?

350
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,045
Four hundred and eighty.

351
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:04,590
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

352
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,009
No, no.

353
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,554
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

354
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:12,557
What?

355
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:16,060
What?

356
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,312
Thousand.

357
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,233
Not on your back,
in case you throw up.

358
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:25,736
On your side. Sleep on your side.

359
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:37,164
And she's all like:

360
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:40,918
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

361
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:43,796
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

362
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,841
I'm conversing
about life and death."

363
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,760
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

364
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:52,013
...hell, Becky knows.

365
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,228
Dad?

366
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:01,606
I overslept. I'm on my way.

367
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:17,455
Dad?

368
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,458
Dad, wait.

369
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,127
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

370
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,463
Dad.

371
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:30,009
Dad, will just wait? Let me--
Just talk to you for one second.

372
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:31,302
No, Dad.

373
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,804
Dad, come on.

374
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:38,809
Dad?

375
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:43,314
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

376
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:45,858
-Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
-Son of a bitch.

377
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:50,655
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

378
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:53,699
-Get away from me, man. Back off.
-Jesse.

379
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:54,951
-Jesse, no!
-Back off!

380
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,870
-Okay, everybody just calm down!
-What's with you, yo?

381
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,374
-Because I'll seriously bust you up.
-You miserable little smackhead.

382
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:03,668
-Get the hell out!
-Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

383
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:05,336
All right? I got civil rights.

384
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,296
Dad, no! Okay!

385
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:10,007
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

386
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,010
I pay my rent.

387
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:17,181
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

388
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,767
Look, as it so happens,
we were just....

389
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:21,602
We were just talking
about that now.

390
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:24,021
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

391
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,691
-If you would just let me.
-Eighteen months.

392
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:30,319
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

393
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,698
I backslid, okay?

394
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,658
Like, what?

395
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,869
What, you think I'm proud of this?

396
00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:39,912
Like I do it on purpose?

397
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:41,539
Lying to me...

398
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:44,709
...shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

399
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,085
It takes one to know one.

400
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:49,213
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

401
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:52,049
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

402
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:55,136
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

403
00:27:55,928 --> 00:28:00,224
Thank you for not being judgemental
24 hours a day.

404
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:04,312
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

405
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:07,398
Okay.

406
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,942
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

407
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:11,193
What are you doing?

408
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:14,030
-What are you doing?
-I am calling the police.

409
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:18,034
-Dad. Dad, no, don't.
-Come on. Come on!

410
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:20,286
-Dad, no. Don't.
-I have tried 10 years...

411
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:21,996
...of love and understanding.

412
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,333
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

413
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:26,918
Dad, no.

414
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:30,504
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

415
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:33,966
-Dad. Daddy, no.
-No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

416
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,927
-I'd like to talk to somebody.
-Daddy.

417
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:38,763
-Would you connect me, please?
-Fine, we'll go to rehab.

418
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:41,015
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

419
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:43,643
-I want you in rehab.
-I'll go first thing tomorrow.

420
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,561
Not tomorrow. Today.

421
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,023
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

422
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:53,194
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

423
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:58,783
Daddy, please?

424
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:00,201
I'll go.

425
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,954
<i>Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?</i>

426
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:05,456
Tomorrow.

427
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:07,333
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,170
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:13,130
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

430
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:19,804
Tomorrow.

431
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:40,157
You meant all that?

432
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,536
I don't know.

433
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:47,164
I just think
if we had enough money...

434
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:50,668
...nobody could make us
do anything.

435
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,532
Oh, just let it ring.

436
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:24,202
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

437
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,122
It's okay, Holly.

438
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:30,541
It's okay, sweetie.

439
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,460
Good luck with that.

440
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:36,214
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some--

441
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:41,135
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

442
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:43,471
-What?
-It's one of your....

443
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,683
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

444
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:51,229
Oh, okay. Thanks.

445
00:30:51,437 --> 00:30:54,565
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

446
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,986
<i>-This is Walter White.
-Hello, Walter White.</i>

447
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:05,576
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling--

448
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:07,286
It's Jane.

449
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:09,413
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

450
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:10,873
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

451
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:16,128
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

452
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:17,880
Get somewhere
where you can talk.

453
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:22,760
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

454
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:28,766
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

455
00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:31,727
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

456
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:33,437
No more, no less.

457
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:35,106
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

458
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:36,941
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

459
00:31:40,987 --> 00:31:44,740
<i>-He told you about the money.
-He told me everything.</i>

460
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:51,956
So, what is this?

461
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,793
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

462
00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:57,962
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

463
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,630
Bring him what you owe him.

464
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,257
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

465
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:04,635
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

466
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:06,387
Well, I call it blackmail.

467
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:10,349
Dialling my number.
Talking to my wife.

468
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,602
And what's your end of this?

469
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,147
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

470
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:20,318
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him...

471
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,653
<i>...and he will receive
every last dollar of it.</i>

472
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:24,322
He will, not you...

473
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,157
...at a time when I see fit.

474
00:32:26,365 --> 00:32:28,826
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

475
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,746
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean--</i>

476
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:33,956
<i>-If you both get clean--
-You know what?</i>

477
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,833
I take that back. This is blackmail.

478
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,419
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher...

479
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:41,255
<i>...turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>

480
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:44,675
<i>...that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.</i>

481
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:50,640
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

482
00:32:58,689 --> 00:32:59,732
Shit.

483
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:06,364
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

484
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:09,200
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

485
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:15,164
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

486
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:17,542
We won't have to. He'll pay.

487
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:20,127
And what if he doesn't?

488
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:22,213
Jesse, it's your money.

489
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:26,884
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

490
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,224
What is it, really?

491
00:33:33,432 --> 00:33:35,810
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

492
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:39,564
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

493
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:45,278
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

494
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:48,739
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

495
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:56,747
I mean, he's my partner.

496
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,711
I'm your partner.

497
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:12,096
<i>The largest land animal
in all the planet...</i>

498
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:14,974
<i>...lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society...</i>

499
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,268
<i>...led by the eldest female
in the herd.</i>

500
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:22,273
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

501
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:18,579
She is finally asleep.

502
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,170
What you doing,
learning about elephants?

503
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:41,185
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

504
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:20,016
Jesse.

505
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:22,226
Not you.

506
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:38,201
Nice job wearing the pants.

507
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,585
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

508
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:50,171
I guess you don't.

509
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:55,718
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

510
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:01,724
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

511
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,893
You are making a mistake.

512
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:22,620
-Do you know what this is?
-It's a whole lot of cheddar.

513
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:24,413
This is freedom.

514
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:27,458
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

515
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,961
I can be anybody."

516
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:31,629
Who do you wanna be?

517
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:34,966
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

518
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:38,469
-Is New Zealand part of Australia?
-New Zealand is New Zealand.

519
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:39,762
Right on.

520
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:43,140
<i>New Zealand. That's where
they made Lord of the Rings.</i>

521
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:46,227
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

522
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:49,188
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

523
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:51,482
And I can be a bush pilot.

524
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:54,277
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

525
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:58,573
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

526
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,498
But first, we gotta get clean.

527
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:09,667
And not because
anybody is telling us to.

528
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:14,797
-We do this for us, right?
-Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

529
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,967
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

530
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:19,218
We're not.

531
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,929
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

532
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:24,765
We're way better than that. I say....

533
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:28,811
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

534
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:34,233
Yeah, we can do that.

535
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:36,527
Definitely.

536
00:38:40,823 --> 00:38:42,533
Excuse me.

537
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,877
What can I get you?

538
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:57,089
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.

539
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:04,847
Damn it.

540
00:39:07,642 --> 00:39:09,393
Hey, honey.

541
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:12,271
No. I don't know what to tell you.

542
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,776
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

543
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:20,696
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

544
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:23,783
What if we went up a size
and just kind of....

545
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:26,619
All right, all right. No, I understand.

546
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:29,830
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

547
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:33,709
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so....

548
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:36,671
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

549
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,506
Thank you.

550
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,758
God.

551
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:43,970
Well played.

552
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,856
They found water on Mars.

553
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:58,276
They have indeed.

554
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,945
Don't know what to do
with that information...

555
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:03,614
...but, hey, God bless them,
they found it.

556
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,077
Oh, well, actually...

557
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:12,999
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

558
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:17,420
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

559
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:21,966
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

560
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:23,968
So it's a....

561
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:28,806
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

562
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:33,936
-To water on Mars.
-To water on Mars.

563
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:40,109
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

564
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,654
-Little girl.
-That's nice.

565
00:40:43,863 --> 00:40:45,072
-Thanks.
-Congratulations.

566
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,324
Thank you.

567
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:48,993
-I have a daughter.
-Yeah?

568
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:50,828
How old?

569
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:52,496
Old enough to know better.

570
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:55,333
Twenty-seven next month.

571
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:01,130
-You have other kids?
-Just the one.

572
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,802
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

573
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:11,140
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

574
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:13,726
But he helps out, though.

575
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,812
He's even changing some diapers
now, so....

576
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:20,233
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

577
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:24,028
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

578
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,490
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

579
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:31,077
So, any advice?

580
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,914
Having a daughter. Any advice?

581
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:38,709
No, not really. Just love them.

582
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:40,545
Just-- Yeah.

583
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:44,298
I mean, they are who they are.

584
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,552
Yeah.

585
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:52,848
I've got this nephew.

586
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:59,146
This nephew who is--
I mean, he's an adult.

587
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:05,695
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

588
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:09,782
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

589
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:11,492
You know, that....

590
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:15,079
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

591
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:19,333
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

592
00:42:21,544 --> 00:42:23,629
But of course, they don't.

593
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,426
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

594
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,511
Family?

595
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:36,893
Yeah. Family.

596
00:42:37,602 --> 00:42:40,104
You can't give up on them. Never.

597
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:43,357
I mean, what else is there?

598
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:32,198
Jesse, it's me.

599
00:43:38,037 --> 00:43:41,457
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

600
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:20,913
Jesus.

601
00:44:37,263 --> 00:44:38,806
Jesse.

602
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,396
Jesse.

603
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,692
Jesse, wake up.

604
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:52,528
Jesse, wake up.

605
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:23,267
No, no, no.
