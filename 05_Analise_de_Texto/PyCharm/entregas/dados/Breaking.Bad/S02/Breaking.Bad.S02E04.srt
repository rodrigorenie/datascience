1
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:52,227
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,565
What's up, brother?
-Hey, bro.

3
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,834
This is stupid.

4
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:20,922
You got a better idea?
-Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:24,259
So when do we, you know?
-We don't, for now.

6
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,678
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:30,765
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:33,101
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

9
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:37,772
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't-

10
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,567
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:52,620
Look, I can't leave my house...

12
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,206
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:57,250
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,296
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,133
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:18,063
That's $600.

17
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,647
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,319
Rest of what?
-Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,738
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:30,116
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,285
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:35,372
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:45,006
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,927
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:52,514
Where are you going?

26
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,517
I leave first.

27
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,788
Walt!
-In the kitchen.

28
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,471
Hey.

29
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:37,809
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:41,312
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,064
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,611
What?

33
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,616
Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,369
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:59,414
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,877
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,088
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

38
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:10,258
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,596
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:18,600
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,145
I wanted to.

42
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,317
Grapefruit juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:31,071
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,615
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:39,329
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,081
Yeah.
-There you go.

47
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:43,792
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,961
No.
-Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,756
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

50
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:52,801
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,553
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

52
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,890
That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,642
You too.

54
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:05,146
Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

55
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:08,858
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,068
Bye.
-You're welcome.

57
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:11,861
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,488
All right.

59
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,786
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,247
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:23,957
Come to think of it...

62
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:26,793
...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
-Stop it.

63
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,171
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,798
Thank you.

65
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,427
Hey, listen...

66
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,846
...in the calendar section...

67
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,515
...all week long...

68
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:45,061
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

69
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,648
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

70
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,359
...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

71
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:57,407
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

72
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,452
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:14,007
Oh, and...

74
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:18,136
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,680
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,391
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

77
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,730
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:35,403
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

79
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:38,740
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,911
And, well, the weird thing is that...

81
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,915
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

82
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:50,251
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

83
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,089
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:57,425
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

85
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,928
...other than the phone ring, but...

86
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:03,306
They so overcomplicate
these things.

87
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:08,937
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:12,315
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:16,361
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

90
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,614
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,661
Skyler?

92
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:37,966
Skyler?

93
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,977
Ready?
-Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,697
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,000
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

96
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,045
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

97
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,214
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

98
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,341
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

99
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:06,096
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,557
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,185
It's your aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave it to me.

102
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,895
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:16,856
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

104
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,318
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:24,239
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,866
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,744
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:32,247
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:36,042
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,545
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:45,593
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

112
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:49,597
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

113
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,766
...so you're welcome.

114
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:54,144
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:56,271
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:56,479 --> 00:11:00,358
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

117
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:04,946
...and I found your laboratory.

118
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:09,951
You guys have your own key?

119
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,919
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

120
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,881
...is a second degree felony.

121
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:26,343
Under federal asset seizure...

122
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,721
...the government can take
the entire house.

123
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:33,600
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:36,311
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,939
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

126
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,109
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,320
Otherwise,
your parents have authorised me...

128
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:48,948
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,744
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,832
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,211
Come on.

132
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,461
Hi.
-Hey.

133
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:55,056
I fixed the garage door.
-Great.

134
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:56,683
Yeah.

135
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,561
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,312
Okay.

137
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:06,234
Where were you today?
-Out.

138
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,957
Is everything okay?

139
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,961
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:44,105
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

141
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,191
...the cancer support group.

142
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,234
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:51,112
Yeah.

144
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,240
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,410
You were right
on the money about that.

146
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:59,913
It's good to, you know...

147
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,874
...talk about things.

148
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,502
I think that's great.

149
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,216
Yeah.

150
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,577
Jesse.

151
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,666
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:47,377
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,964
Yeah, no, I've just been...

154
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:53,800
...pretty busy. How'd you-?

155
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:57,762
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,306
Hey, listen.

157
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,727
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

158
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,356
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

159
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:11,901
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

160
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,822
It's not just your father, Jesse.
-No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:21,244
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

162
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,414
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

163
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:28,043
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,712
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now...

165
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,424
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:38,386
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:41,931
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,352
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,936
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:50,315
I thought it was just a wake-up call.
-We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,734
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,236
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:58,573
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:02,077
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,536
I earned this.

176
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:06,081
You did not make
her lunch every day.

177
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,041
What did you do, huh?

178
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,919
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:13,421
Don't start with me.
-Now what?

180
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,925
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,387
Great family, Mom.

182
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,516
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:39,030
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,075
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,660
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,955
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:50,458
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,965
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:02,303
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,433
Jeez.

191
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:19,988
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,949
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,492
Come in and say hello.

194
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,579
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

195
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,830
No, I'm good.

196
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,000
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

197
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,085
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:36,004
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:40,008
Who's Flynn?
-Flynn.

200
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,177
He's your...

201
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:48,224
Flynn?
-Yeah.

202
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,018
So?

203
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,104
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:55,940
You ready?
-Like it.

205
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,859
Bye, Mr. White.
-Okay.

206
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,237
Bye.

207
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,581
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,631
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,093
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,178
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,389
Don't take it personally.

212
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,558
He wants his own identity.

213
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:38,650
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,320
About the blackout?
-Louis is his friend, Walt...

215
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,115
...and your disappearance
upset him.

216
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,622
Hey, I made omelettes.

217
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,375
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,127
Where you going?

219
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,714
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,593
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:13,768
<i>-White residence.
-Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

222
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:18,148
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,484
<i>-I know, but there's a problem.
-I don't care. We agreed.</i>

224
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,779
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:27,282
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,369
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,457
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,796
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,423
Out.

230
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:48,511
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,722
Skyler.

232
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,230
What?
-Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

233
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,900
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,818
I just gave you $600.

235
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,320
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

236
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,614
...but that was
before my housing situation...

237
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:09,949
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

238
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,160
<i>You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?</i>

239
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,662
<i>-What? No.
-Yes.</i>

240
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,954
<i>-No.
-Look, Jesse...</i>

241
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,706
<i>...your problems are just that.:</i>

242
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,583
Your problems.

243
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,503
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:25,590
<i>-When the moment is right, I will call.
-Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>

245
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,009
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,189
You son of a bitch.

247
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,904
Son of a bitch.

248
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,866
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:55,036
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:58,873
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,460
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,336
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:47,756
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:50,091
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,135
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:56,348
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,682
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,310
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:03,021
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:06,566
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,860
Yeah.

262
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,238
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:13,448
Too hot.

264
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:16,701
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,328
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:21,039
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:23,375
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:28,380
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,800
Damn. I'm hating, man.

270
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:34,928
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

271
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:38,723
Get you out of the house.
-How awesome would that be?

272
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:40,600
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:44,312
I cut all the green parts off like you-
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:48,108
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:49,442
Get back in the scene.

276
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:52,487
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:55,782
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

278
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:57,659
...and then you take-

279
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,453
Mommy's home.

280
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:03,540
Hi.
-Hello.

281
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,167
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,171
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,298
Hey, Jesse.
-Hey.

284
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:15,010
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,597
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,204
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

287
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:51,254
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,017
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,855
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,482
You got other people to call?

291
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,068
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,403
Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:19,074
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:23,078
Sucks to be you, P.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,789
Here.

296
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,415
See you, man.

297
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:29,626
It's good to see you.

298
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:34,923
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and-

299
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:38,093
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:40,762
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,431
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:48,603
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:51,523
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:12,293
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:15,588
You cannot be serious.
-Hey.

306
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,967
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:21,177
Not cool.

308
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:38,166
Morning.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,751
Morning.

310
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,088
Where did-? Where did Mom go?

311
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,591
Out.

312
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:55,058
Where's breakfast?

313
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:00,355
Hey.

314
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,400
Let's go do something.

315
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,277
Like what?

316
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,322
Something fun.

317
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:14,119
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:18,373
Is your foot on the-Okay. Good.
-Yeah. I got it.

319
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:22,752
Good.

320
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,589
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:30,385
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:32,887
Okay, let's slow down here...

323
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:36,224
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:39,352
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,272
Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,401
Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:48,903
Has he?

328
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:51,448
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,700
Don't forget the turn indic-Good.

330
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:56,328
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:59,372
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:03,293
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,129
Right hand.

334
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,174
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,638
Are you using both feet?
-Yeah.

336
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,016
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:20,352
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,271
Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,234
Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:31,655
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,949
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:36,868
All right.
-Okay?

343
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:44,876
Okay, just-You don't have to-
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:47,962
Just-That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:51,966
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:54,427
Okay.

347
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:58,014
Don't-Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,725
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:02,644
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,312
I can't do this.

351
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,690
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,734
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:09,943 --> 00:31:12,862
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,491
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,868
All right.
-Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:23,957
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:26,918
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:31,798
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:34,342
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:36,344
Braking.
-You're using both feet again.

361
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,847
It's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:40,849
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,355
Okay.

364
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:49,774
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,527
I told you.

366
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,195
Flynn.

367
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:06,267
Hands up, asshole!
-Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:08,103
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:11,398
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:14,442
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:17,278
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,406
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:23,618
You smell like shit.
-It's a long story.

374
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:26,329
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

375
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:27,747
...750 for the repair.

376
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:31,167
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:36,131
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,757
Okay.

379
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,051
Here's the thing.

380
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,636
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,222
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

382
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:50,437
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:53,565
I thought your word was your bond.
-It totally is.

384
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:57,402
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:00,947
But I will, soon.

386
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,366
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,703
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,539
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:13,251
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,005
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:21,676
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,220
Please, all right? I really...

393
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:30,226
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,190
Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:57,337
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:00,256
There's something called
methylamine. Me-Meth...

397
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,884
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:06,346
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:15,397
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:35:22,404 --> 00:35:23,738
Hey! Hey!

401
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:00,108
Skyler.

402
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,950
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,038
I was thinking maybe...

404
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:15,707
...this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:42,651
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,237
In Ireland.

407
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:50,950
Weird.

408
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,163
Sounds weird.

409
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:11,096
I wanted to apologise...

410
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,306
...for everything.

411
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,643
My...

412
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,188
...desire for privacy.

413
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:24,025
My emotional...

414
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,611
...unavailability.

415
00:37:28,238 --> 00:37:31,324
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,829
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

417
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:39,708
...and for that...

418
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,460
...I'm very sorry.

419
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,381
I love you.

420
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,135
And I love this family.

421
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:53,555
And I just...

422
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,932
...want to make sure that...

423
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:59,060
...we don't lose contact.

424
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,528
Thank you.

425
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:10,405
Okay.

426
00:38:15,702 --> 00:38:17,162
I agree.

427
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,262
Is that it?

428
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,890
God.

429
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,267
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

430
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,020
Do what?
-This.

431
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,022
Not talking to me.

432
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:47,734
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:50,195
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

434
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:52,530
...so let's talk about it.

435
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:02,499
Oh, God.

436
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:07,754
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

437
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:11,257
...that I'm up to something.

438
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:16,388
Like what?
-I have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:19,808
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

440
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:22,060
Is that why you asked me
about the...

441
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:25,647
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:29,693
I don't know.
-Okay.

443
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,778
So ask me.

444
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,739
Why?

445
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:38,284
Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

446
00:39:38,493 --> 00:39:40,328
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:45,792
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,670
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

449
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:52,340
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

450
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,342
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,678
You're not having an affair.

452
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,513
Congratulations.

453
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:01,141
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:02,434
Great job.

455
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:04,352
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:08,481
I'm trying to talk to you, and you-
-Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:13,320
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:17,490
You want to know
what you have to do?

459
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:21,745
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,789
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:29,002
No more apologies.
No more of these-These obvious...

462
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,796
...desperate breakfasts.

463
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:36,301
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:38,053
Good.

465
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,138
Then tell me.

466
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,224
Now.

467
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,404
Tell you what?

468
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:03,953
Skyler.

469
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,085
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,597
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,267
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,483
What the-?

473
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:52,585
Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
-What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:55,296
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:58,925
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

476
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:02,929
...kleptomaniac douche bags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:04,931
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal-

478
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,269
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:13,690
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,860
Nothing. I'm sorry. I just-
-What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,946
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:22,490
I don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,868
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,787
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:31,666
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:34,294
Your half?

487
00:42:34,502 --> 00:42:37,005
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:39,758
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:43,261
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,430
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:47,432
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:50,685
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:54,105
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:58,526
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:03,948
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

496
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:07,702
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re-

497
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:29,808
Do it.

498
00:43:57,377 --> 00:44:01,506
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,168
Want some breakfast?
