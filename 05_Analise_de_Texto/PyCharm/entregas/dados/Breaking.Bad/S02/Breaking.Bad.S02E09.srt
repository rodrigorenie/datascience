1
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:28,523
These people.

2
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:30,108
Pathetic.

3
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,279
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:36,447
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:39,867
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,495
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:45,290
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:48,209
<i>It is a full PETICT, correct?</i>

9
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:52,505
<i>You definitely want the PETICT
and not just the PET.</i>

10
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:56,175
<i>Yeah, it's a PETICT.</i>

11
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:58,845
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:02,390
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,435
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:09,689
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,566
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:14,444
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

17
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,404
...to get the results.

18
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:19,574
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:21,367
I could take one look at Walt's...

20
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:23,912
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,915
Really.
-Doctors like people to think...

22
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:30,585
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

23
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:34,923
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:42,430
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:44,682
Excuse me.

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,820
You all right in there?

27
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:00,865
Yeah.

28
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,246
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:07,956
Yes.

30
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,377
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:39,737
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:44,993
So how'd we do?
-You did fine.

33
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,331
See anything?
-I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,376
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:55,003
Sorry.

36
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:36,836
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:40,632
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,509
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:47,680
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,891
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,435
Weeks.

42
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,229
Maybe.

43
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:55,897
Sorry to hear it.

44
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:59,734
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:02,737
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:05,657
How much money
are we laundering?

47
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,994
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,414
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,918
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,586
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:24,133
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

52
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,887
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

53
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,266
...comes to $9960.

54
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:35,103
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:38,856
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:41,442
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:44,904
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,205
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:57,709
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:02,422
Actually, I...

61
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,094
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,268
Really?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:18,897
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:26,070
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:32,827
God, Walt.

66
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:36,915
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

67
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:40,501
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm all for positive...

69
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:46,591
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,176
It...

71
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,262
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:52,847
I know.

73
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:56,434
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:58,728
You know, forgive me.

75
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:03,066
Look...

76
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:06,194
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if-

77
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,987
If...

78
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,198
...I'm no longer around.

79
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,661
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:21,209
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,339
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,302
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,057
A 30-minute discourse...

84
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:39,727
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,231
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:49,737
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

87
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:08,548
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:13,094
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:16,389
Yeah.

90
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:29,444
We should do something.
-Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:32,113
No, something else.

92
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,116
We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:38,119
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:40,455
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,210
Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:47,337
She's a painter.

97
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:49,923
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:52,008
No, is that bad?

99
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:56,971
Boy, you need some educating.
-Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,308
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:04,103
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,898
So romantic.

103
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:09,776
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:14,822
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:17,325
It's the shit.

106
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,619
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:23,414
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.

108
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:25,917
Really?

109
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:32,257
Is there still cereal?
-Yeah.

110
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:42,392
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

111
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,353
<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

112
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:48,773
<i>-Hello? Jesse, pick up-
-Hold on, hold on.</i>

113
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:51,025
Sorry, one sec.

114
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:58,783
<i>-What?
-I've been trying to reach you.</i>

115
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,159
Where's your drop phone?

116
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,956
<i>-I've been busy.
-Well, clear your social calendar.</i>

117
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:08,710
<i>-We have to cook.
-What? Today?</i>

118
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,337
<i>No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.</i>

119
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:13,798
<i>Now, we're going to need
all new glassware...</i>

120
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,509
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

121
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:19,596
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:22,765
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,727
<i>Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...</i>

124
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:28,438
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

125
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:30,732
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?</i>

126
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,902
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,323
You're going to a museum, huh?
-Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:41,576
<i>-Georgia O'Keeffe?
-She's a painter, duh.</i>

129
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,244
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,581
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,208
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,586
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:53,880
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:57,425
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:59,093
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:02,347
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:06,768
Tuesday? Four days straight?
-Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:10,271
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>

139
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,442
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:16,903
<i>-What?
-It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

141
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,240
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you...

142
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:21,741
<i>Hell, no.</i>

143
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,577
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,996
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

145
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:32,293
<i>-Come on.
-All right, all right. Go.</i>

146
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:35,380
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,799
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,051
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

149
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,679
Me too.

150
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:44,639
But I'll be back before you know it...

151
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:47,559
...and you can always call
if you need me.

152
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:52,355
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:04,284
Love you.

154
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:09,122
Fly safe, okay?
-Okay.

155
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,647
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...</i>

156
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:36,232
<i>...of passengers only.</i>

157
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,318
<i>No parking.</i>

158
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,704
<i>Attention, passengers.:
Please maintain visual contact...</i>

159
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:52,248
<i>...with your personal belongings

<i>Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated...</i>

161
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,045
<i>...by airport personnel.</i>

162
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:07,639
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

163
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,475
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

164
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:12,852
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

165
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,396
Yeah.
-With reflux condensers?

166
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,190
Yes. Like I said, yes.

167
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:22,070
Just go. Drive. Go, go.
-Okay.

168
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:26,324
Good morning to you too, man.

169
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,134
Stupid-
-Three entire bags of Funyuns?

170
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:28,678
What? Funyuns are awesome.

171
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,930
God.
-Hey, more for me.

172
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,017
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:36,519
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:41,149
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,777
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,407
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,326
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:58,082
Hey, let me use yours, would you?
-Absolutely not.

179
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,460
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:02,712
You know that.
-It's not business, all right?

181
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,214
It's personal.
-Oh, personal.

182
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,217
What, female?
-Maybe.

183
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:09,260
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:11,763
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

185
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:15,683
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

186
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,686
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:22,857
Drinking water?
-Yup.

188
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,734
Is that all we've got?

189
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:28,863
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,037
Oh, God.

191
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:45,880
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

192
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,384
Oh, our "workstation."
-That's right.

193
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:53,805
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:55,557
Considering it's our only set...

195
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:58,726
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

196
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:07,902
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:13,027
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,989
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:17,866
That's the last of it.

200
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:23,872
How many total?
-Nineteen.

201
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:27,083
So dollar-wise?

202
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,918
How much?

203
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:32,255
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

204
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:37,218
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at...

205
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:39,804
What are we selling for these days?
-Forty a pound.

206
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:42,807
Forty thousand dollars?
-Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:45,894
All right, that's 40 times 42...

208
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:49,147
...minus distribution charges...

209
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,567
What?

210
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,486
What?

211
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:58,573
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

212
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:01,409
All in?
-No.

213
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:04,245
Each.

214
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:05,872
Each?

215
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,751
Each.
-Six hundred and-?

216
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,420
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:16,090
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,012
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:25,058
Yes! Yes!

220
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,940
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:34,484
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,194
Perfect timing, yo.

223
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:39,280
How do you figure that?
-What do you mean?

224
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:40,490
We're done cooking.

225
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,618
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

226
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:44,994
Look at this.

227
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:48,456
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,793
Come on, where's your ambition?
-Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,295
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:57,465
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

231
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,593
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,388
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

233
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:06,140
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,893
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

235
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:10,603
...and glass up the rest.

236
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:11,813
Come on.

237
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:14,899
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:16,776
Grand Slam?

239
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,153
Hot shower?

240
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:20,488
A bed?

241
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:29,205
Separate rooms.
-Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,793
What the hell?

243
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,547
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:44,304
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

245
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:46,139
...where did you put them?

246
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:51,102
I left them right here in the ignition.
-Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,479
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:55,231
The buzzer didn't buzz.
-The what?

249
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,692
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

250
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:59,527
...to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,404
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:03,907
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:07,035
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:09,370
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:12,207
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,043
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,336
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:18,713
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,548
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:23,384
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

261
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:26,804
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:29,641
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:32,227
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,354
Jesus.
-Okay, just...

265
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:42,487
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:44,322
Okay.

267
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:45,740
How?

268
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,126
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:57,627 --> 00:20:59,504
Oh, damn it.

270
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,882
What's it taste like?

271
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:04,551
Bad, huh?

272
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,060
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

273
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:17,313
Okay. There.

274
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,276
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:30,910
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

276
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,791
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

277
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,919
You have to really pull.
-I am.

278
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:41,921
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,799
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

280
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:48,469
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:51,973
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,310
Oh, jeez.

283
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:23,296
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...

284
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:26,132
Well done.

285
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:29,260
God.

286
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:54,244
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:56,538
Hear me now.

288
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:00,124
Damn it.

289
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,967
Stupid.

290
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:15,306
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

291
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:17,642
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

292
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:19,852
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

293
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:22,814
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

294
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,148
How do you know?

295
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:27,735
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:29,696
That's what I know.
-There was a fire.

297
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:31,739
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:34,033
Is that what you were-?
You were thinking?

299
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:36,077
Now that we have
identified the problem-

300
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:38,496
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

301
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:43,751
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,212
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

303
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:50,091
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:51,759
God.

305
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:57,056
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:23:57,265 --> 00:24:00,351
Roaming drains the battery.
-All right.

307
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:05,356
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:08,735
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:13,406
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:15,450
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:18,119
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:19,662
All right, so you ready?

313
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:23,958
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:28,796
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,840
All right-
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

316
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,259
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

317
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:36,721
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,807
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:42,769
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:47,232
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,234
About another 15 miles.

322
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:52,195
Really? That far?
-Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:55,490
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:59,410
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:03,122
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

326
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,958
Leave now.

327
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:07,001
Here.

328
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,836
He's coming.

329
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:17,679
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

330
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:20,306
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

331
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:23,184
...and he had to drink urine for...

332
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:26,271
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

333
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:32,610
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:38,533
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:42,537
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

336
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:46,374
All right.

337
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:58,511
Come on.

338
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:02,682
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,184
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:07,937
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:11,941
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,611
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,821
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,116
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,410
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:24,996
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:27,749
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:30,168
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you-?

349
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,088
Phone's dead.

350
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:40,637
Now what?

351
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,684
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:51,522
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,808
What's this?

354
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,104
I'm trying to...

355
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:34,065
...trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:36,860
Seriously?

357
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:39,320
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,322
The commutator.

359
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:44,492
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:49,664
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

361
00:27:50,748 --> 00:27:53,960
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled...

362
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:00,300
Anyway.

363
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,346
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:09,934
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

365
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:13,021
...but theoretically...

366
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,149
...it should work.

367
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,652
Theoretically.

368
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,367
It has to work.

369
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,078
You understand?

370
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:40,465
Can I try?

371
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:46,721
Yeah.

372
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,675
How much longer?

373
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,512
I don't know.

374
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,612
Now?

375
00:29:44,821 --> 00:29:46,447
Hey.

376
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:49,075
Mr. White.

377
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,798
Hey.

378
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,676
Yeah?

379
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:12,307
Yo, man, you hanging in?

380
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,018
Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:20,899
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

382
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,446
No, give it a little longer...

383
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:28,740
...just to make sure we're-

384
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:45,882
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

385
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,550
...does it?

386
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:54,349
No. That's not why we're here.

387
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,904
Yo.

388
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:09,948
Lie much?

389
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,666
Here, push.

390
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:37,183
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:40,061
Now.

392
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,189
Go on.

393
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:48,653
Please, please, please.

394
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:08,548
Yes. Yes.

395
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:15,346
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

396
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:18,057
No. God.

397
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,187
Please. Please.

398
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:43,541
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

399
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,711
Why? Why?

400
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:54,427
Mr. White.

401
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,262
Mr. White!

402
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,480
What are you doing?

403
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:08,816
Mr. White?

404
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:12,028
Oh, God.

405
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:31,631
I have this coming.

406
00:33:34,217 --> 00:33:35,677
What?

407
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:40,473
I have it coming.

408
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:44,602
I deserve this.

409
00:33:45,144 --> 00:33:47,021
Hey, snap out of it.

410
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,192
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

411
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:52,902
Right?

412
00:33:54,904 --> 00:33:57,740
All I ever managed to do...

413
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:01,286
...was worry and disappoint them...

414
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:03,830
...and lie.

415
00:34:05,415 --> 00:34:06,624
Oh, God.

416
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,752
All the lies.

417
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:13,464
I can't even...

418
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:16,676
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

419
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:20,555
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:24,350
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:28,855
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,318
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:38,364
Your body...

424
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:42,410
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:47,707
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:50,376
And when they're gone...

427
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,380
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:34:55,089 --> 00:35:00,678
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:04,891
You go marching out there...

430
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,978
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

431
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:13,274
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

432
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:15,401
...and think of something scientific.

433
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,863
Something-
Something scientific, right.

434
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:22,033
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:24,911
You made poison out of beans, yo.

436
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,373
All right, look. We got-

437
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:33,711
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,964
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

439
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,758
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,886
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

441
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:45,390
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

442
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:48,309
...or a homing device...

443
00:35:48,518 --> 00:35:50,353
...or build a new battery or...

444
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,397
Or wait, no.

445
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:54,858
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

446
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,528
...and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:35:58,736 --> 00:36:01,614
You know, like a...
Like a dune buggy.

448
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:05,285
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or...

449
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,456
What? Hey. What is it?

450
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,001
What?

451
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,796
Do you have any money?

452
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,131
Change, I mean. Coins.

453
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:21,134
Yeah, I got a bunch from the-
-Okay.

454
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,177
Yes.
-Gather them.

455
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:27,265
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

456
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:30,852
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,647
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:37,066
Solid zinc, okay.
-And-And bring me-

459
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:39,652
Bring me brake pads.

460
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:43,448
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:36:43,656 --> 00:36:46,409
Okay. Brake pads, okay.
-Brake pads.

462
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,998
What are we building?

463
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,752
You said it yourself.
-A robot?

464
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:58,087
A battery.
-Yes.

465
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,173
Move!

466
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:15,605
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

467
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:17,982
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:21,945
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:26,074
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:27,951
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:30,495
Well, think about it.

472
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:34,374
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:37,335
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

474
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:39,671
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:42,465
Right.
-Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:46,302
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

477
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,721
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

478
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,101
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:57,564
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:00,400
Then... Here, I'll show you.

481
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:03,152
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:05,196
This.

483
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:08,157
It's zinc.

484
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:13,454
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:17,083
So the sponge is the electrolyte?
-Yeah.

486
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:21,170
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:25,466
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:27,927
Good.

489
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:33,725
Good. And now, what shall we use...

490
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,603
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

491
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,150
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:49,824
Wire.

493
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:53,494
Copper.

494
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,747
Oh, I mean-
-Copper.

495
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:57,373
Right.

496
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:02,462
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,590
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:08,676
We've only got material enough
for six.

499
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:15,767
Okay.

500
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:21,814
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:23,483
All right.

502
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:27,445
Cathode.

503
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:34,160
Anode.

504
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,372
Damn. That is good.

505
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,875
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:01,855
Come on.

507
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:48,526
<i>Attention, passengers.:
Please maintain visual contact...</i>

508
00:40:48,735 --> 00:40:51,029

00:40:53,948 --> 00:40:55,700
How's the...?

511
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,454
It's fine.

512
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:13,760
I know I can trust you to...

513
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:17,096
Yeah.

514
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:21,726
Hey, whatever happens...

515
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:24,604
...your family will get your share.

516
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:29,025
Thank you.

517
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:39,619
So...

518
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:46,626
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

519
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:51,965
Yeah.

520
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:12,652
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

521
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:18,575
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:23,830
I know. I know, enough already. It's-
-I'm teasing.

523
00:42:24,038 --> 00:42:25,999
Everything in its time.

524
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,461
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,383
Yeah.
-You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:41,598
Oh, my God.
-I wanna clarify.

527
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:44,517
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:47,103
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:49,355
To classify someone
as in remission...

530
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:52,275
...we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

531
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:54,861
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,613
Technically speaking...

533
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:59,866
...a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before...

534
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:02,535
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:06,289
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...

536
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:08,499
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

537
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:12,337
...at least a 25-to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass...

538
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:18,051
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:20,053
Everybody still with me?

540
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:25,225
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:28,811
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542
00:43:34,734 --> 00:43:36,569
Oh, my God.
-Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

543
00:43:36,778 --> 00:43:39,030
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.

544
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:41,658
Is-? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,913
Mom, yeah.
-Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:50,250
Okay, but, I'm-Wait-
-Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:53,211
It's very good news.
-It's very good news.

548
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:56,464
Oh, my God.
-My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:43:56,673 --> 00:44:00,885
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:11,312
That's great.

551
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:16,192
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:20,280
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:23,616
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:26,202
See that scary-looking thing there?

555
00:44:26,995 --> 00:44:30,248
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

556
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:33,710
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:36,004
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:44:36,212 --> 00:44:39,132
Tissue inflammation? I...

559
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,301
Are you sure about that? I mean, I-

560
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:47,307
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:44:48,725 --> 00:44:50,518
What?
-You probably have a tear...

562
00:44:50,727 --> 00:44:52,312
...in your oesophagus
from coughing.

563
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,315
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,902
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,988
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:04,741
I'm sorry, I just-
-No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:08,661
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:13,041
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:15,168
But now at least
we have some options...

570
00:45:15,376 --> 00:45:18,254
...the most important of which
is time.

571
00:45:19,505 --> 00:45:21,758
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:25,762
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

573
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:31,100
Yes.
-Yeah.

574
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:32,477
Oh, my God.
