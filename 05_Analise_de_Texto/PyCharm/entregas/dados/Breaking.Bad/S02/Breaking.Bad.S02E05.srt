1
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,871
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,623
Here at the end of round one...

3
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,084
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

4
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,420
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

5
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,465
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:45,426
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:48,471
Yeah.

8
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,598
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,351
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,436
And your hair should start
to come back.

11
00:02:57,063 --> 00:03:00,149
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:04,696
I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
-Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:09,284
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:13,997
No more-?
-No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,624
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:19,919
Fine.

17
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,256
I mean, you know, we're busy...

18
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:26,134
...but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:29,137
It's all good.

20
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:37,103
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:39,189
Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,858
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,886
Thank you.

24
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,065
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,901
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:27,904
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:31,866
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,369
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,079
Okay.

30
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,083
Congratulations.

31
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,086
Thank you.

32
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,892
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:00,144
Can you-?
Can you please explain to me...

34
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:04,566
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,947
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

36
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,785
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

37
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,788
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

38
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:23,459
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

39
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:25,670
Yeah. Okay.

40
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,464
Bitch.

41
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,341
Hi.

42
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:34,971
Been around someone
who smokes?

43
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,431
No.

44
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,641
The hospital bill came.

45
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,810
That was fast.
-Yeah.

46
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:45,106
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

47
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:56,075
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

48
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:58,995
I mean...

49
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:03,333
...I know it's strictly your domain,
but...

50
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,627
They will. I'm sure they will.

51
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,462
I'll handle it.

52
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,287
Oh, God.

53
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:49,374
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

54
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:50,625
Dead.
-Still?

55
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,044
Completely.
-Okay, then.

56
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,797
Well, thanks for stopping by.
-Okay.

57
00:08:57,715 --> 00:09:00,969
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

58
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:03,513
Good.
-Of course, that's not gonna last.

59
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,683
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

60
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,309
No takers so far?

61
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:11,855
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

62
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:14,482
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

63
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:16,985
Heisenberg?
-Yeah, I know.

64
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:19,863
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

65
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:24,200
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

66
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,870
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

67
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:31,457
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

68
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:38,047
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

69
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:40,758
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

70
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,052
...in pursuit of their prey.

71
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,221
Yeah, I think I heard that.

72
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:49,392
You, my friend, are a great white.

73
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:52,520
How does Albuquerque liaison...

74
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:56,065
...Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

75
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,401
Like one hell of a promotion.

76
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,280
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and EI Paso.

77
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,908
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

78
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,160
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

79
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:10,955
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

80
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:13,958
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

81
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,586
I'm the whole package.
-I'm glad I didn't just eat.

82
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:19,255
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

83
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:22,133
You wanna grab lunch?
-Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

84
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:25,094
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

85
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,263
Try not to get lost on the way.

86
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:29,474
Schrader.

87
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:30,808
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

88
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:33,645
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

89
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,522
Yeah, EI Paso.

90
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:39,067
Here's the man.

91
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,280
Hey, congratulations, Hank.
-Thanks.

92
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:49,262
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

93
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,765
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

94
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,601
Hey. Hey.

95
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,428
Hey.
-Got some nerve coming back here.

96
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:32,555
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

97
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:34,891
Yeah, well, maybe both.

98
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:46,069
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

99
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:51,074
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

100
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:54,077
...the toilet.

101
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,622
Look, like I said...

102
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,708
...my word is my bond.

103
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:18,226
What would you charge me
to store this here?

104
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:21,354
A million-five.
-Come on, yo.

105
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,773
Your sister.
-Dog, I'm serious, all right?

106
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:28,611
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

107
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,239
We could, you know, negotiate.

108
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:37,745
Five hundred.

109
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,247
A month?
-A week.

110
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:43,209
For real?

111
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,044
See you.
-Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:47,463
Just hold on. Just chill.

113
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,177
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

114
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:54,470
Outside.
-Inside.

115
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,306
Forget it.
-Man, come on.

116
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:59,559
Your fence is too easy to climb.

117
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,312
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

118
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,482
Come again?
-Gate, in and out, privileges.

119
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:11,404
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

120
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:14,157
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

121
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,658
Yeah.

122
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:30,298
You selling?

123
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,425
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

124
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,310
What about that one?

125
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,774
Serious?

126
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,131
It's Jane, right?

127
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,802
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

128
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,014
Really? Does it inspire awe?
-No. I mean, you know, it's great.

129
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:22,642
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

130
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:25,728
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

131
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:30,275
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

132
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:33,486
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

133
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:36,406
Jesus.

134
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:41,035
Utilities are included.

135
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,037
Stacking. Sweet.

136
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,957
You got cable?
-Already wired. Just call to activate.

137
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,792
High speed, whatever.

138
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,670
Bathroom, cool tile.

139
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,714
Bedroom.

140
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:54,048
Nice.

141
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:57,427
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

142
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:01,890
So you're interested?
-Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

143
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:04,058
And you're good with NP, NS?

144
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:07,812
Sorry. What?

145
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:11,191
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

146
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,319
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

147
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:18,615
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
or recent pay stub, current employer...

148
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:21,409
...former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

149
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:25,288
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

150
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:29,125
Yeah. Look...

151
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,793
...the thing is...

152
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,629
...I can...

153
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:34,297
Unbelievable.

154
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:38,134
I'm just currently between situations.
-Then I'm currently not renting.

155
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:41,971
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

156
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,642
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

157
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,436
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

158
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,813
Trust me.
-Your dad?

159
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:53,816
Owns the place. I manage it.

160
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,236
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

161
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:58,154
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

162
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:00,573
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

163
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,159
And I got no game, all right?

164
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:05,995
I just need a chance.

165
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:12,627
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

166
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:15,797
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

167
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,883
Didn't meet their expectations again.

168
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:21,886
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

169
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:26,224
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

170
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:28,852
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

171
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,021
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

172
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:42,198
Rent just went up.

173
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:45,201
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

174
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,953
Yes.

175
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:49,205
Okay. Yes.

176
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:52,125
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

177
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,044
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

178
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,714
DBAA fee, non-refundable.

179
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:02,468
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

180
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:08,391
All right. So, what's DBAA?

181
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,935
Don't be an asshole.
-Gotcha.

182
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,688
I live next door.
-Really?

183
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:17,233
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

184
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,985
If you blow this, I want you gone.

185
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:22,280
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

186
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:23,865
...faster than you can blink.

187
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,411
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

188
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,913
Which is what, by the way?

189
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,415
It's Jesse.

190
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,419
Jesse Jackson.

191
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:38,588
Seriously?

192
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:41,466
What?

193
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:33,101
What are you doing?
-Beating off. What's it look like?

194
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:36,771
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

195
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,066
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

196
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:43,278
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

197
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,655
So let me get this straight.

198
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:50,451
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

199
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,996
...career-boosting promotion...

200
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:57,500
...so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

201
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:00,086
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

202
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,255
Babe, relax.

203
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,800
Please, don't tell me to relax.
-Sorry, I forgot.

204
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,011
You know I hate that.
-Right.

205
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:09,971
Dave said I should express that.

206
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,891
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

207
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,435
I can take a day.

208
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,353
No big deal.

209
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:23,568
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

210
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:13,136
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

211
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,638
The plan is we cook.

212
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:20,268
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

213
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,864
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

214
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:35,783
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

215
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:37,785
Dude.
-What?

216
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,830
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

217
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,459
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

218
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,879
...but still, what choice do we have?
-First of all, there's no we.

219
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:52,175
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

220
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,593
I got profile now.

221
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:57,013
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

222
00:22:57,222 --> 00:23:00,600
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

223
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:03,353
No way.
-Then what do you suggest?

224
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:08,441
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

225
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:15,865
I got bills, man.

226
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:17,367
You've got bills?

227
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:19,410
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

228
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,412
I've already lost more than
I've made...

229
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:24,290
...and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

230
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:27,544
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

231
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:29,838
After completing
my first round of treatment...

232
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:33,550
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

233
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,718
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

234
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:39,013
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

235
00:23:39,222 --> 00:23:42,642
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

236
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:50,149
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

237
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:53,403
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices.

238
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:56,656
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

239
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,908
...or you and I start-

240
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:02,871
You selling whatever you can.

241
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:07,876
There's a third way.

242
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,254
And what would that be?

243
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:16,176
We got to be Tuco.

244
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,761
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

245
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,807
So you're going to what?

246
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,185
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

247
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:28,438
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

248
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:33,193
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

249
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:37,280
Look, we control production
and distribution.

250
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:40,700
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

251
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:43,953
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

252
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:45,455
Sky-high stacks.

253
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:49,292
No.
-No? That's not the point?

254
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,086
No, I am not willing to do that.

255
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:54,923
Who said anything about you?

256
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:00,094
I don't vote for this plan.

257
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:04,474
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

258
00:25:04,682 --> 00:25:07,227
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

259
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:11,981
I beg your pardon?

260
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,985
This is a partnership, remember?
-I rem-Oh, I remember.

261
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:18,321
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

262
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,824
That was the division of labour
when we started all this.

263
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,202
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

264
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,247
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

265
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:29,666
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

266
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:32,836
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

267
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:43,179
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

268
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:46,307
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

269
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:49,561
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

270
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,437
Yeah, damn straight.

271
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:53,648
Know why?

272
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:56,651
Because we do things
my way this time...

273
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,695
...or I walk.

274
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:06,536
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

275
00:26:27,473 --> 00:26:30,226
<i>Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?</i>

276
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:31,436
What up with it, yo?

277
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:34,898
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

278
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,859
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

279
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,072
Yo, Badge, hey.
-Cool crib, man.

280
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:44,908
Hey, it echoes.

281
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,743
Hello.

282
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:48,912
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

283
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,830
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

284
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,583
So plasma is gonna go right here.

285
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,835
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

286
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:58,254
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

287
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,131
No. They burn in, yo.

288
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,468
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

289
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:06,262
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

290
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,139
That's what I'm waiting for.

291
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:10,558
Porn, coz. You know?
-Jesus.

292
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,269
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

293
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:16,356
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

294
00:27:16,564 --> 00:27:19,400
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

295
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,735
Those are buck.

296
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:23,947
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

297
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:26,282
Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
-Yeah.

298
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,701
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

299
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,329
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

300
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,331
It's gonna be chill.
-The ladies...

301
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,293
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

302
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,630
You are going to score, big time.

303
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:45,301
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

304
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,638
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

305
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:52,475
You got any other refreshments?

306
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:55,562
I could kick it. It's been a while.
-Yes, yes.

307
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,189
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

308
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:00,650
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

309
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,487
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

310
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,323
Okay? So listen up.

311
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:11,202
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

312
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:15,331
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

313
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,293
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

314
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,962
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

315
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:22,672
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

316
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:26,342
Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
-Seventeen.

317
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:30,263
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

318
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:33,892
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

319
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,186
...who else is selling right now,
huh?

320
00:28:36,394 --> 00:28:39,439
It's dry out there, that's for sure.
-Church.

321
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:42,901
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

322
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:46,279
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

323
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:48,698
Short me, you're out.

324
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:50,491
Cut it, you're out.

325
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,327
Period.

326
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:56,456
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

327
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:58,208
Understand?

328
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:01,044
Badger, what is this?

329
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:04,839
A big opportunity.

330
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:08,510
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

331
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:12,222
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

332
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,890
So bring out the product, yo.

333
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:16,851
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

334
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,022
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

335
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,861
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

336
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,863
Now, I got mad volume.

337
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:32,742
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

338
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:36,079
...there is always more.

339
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:40,792
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

340
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,211
Apply yourselves.

341
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:44,504
Hell, yeah.

342
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:46,714
Hell, yeah.

343
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:20,165
Hey, there's the big guy.

344
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:22,625
Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
-Hey, Hank.

345
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,002
It's an armpit.

346
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,962
It's not an armpit.

347
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:27,797
Oh, excuse me.

348
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:30,550
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

349
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:33,136
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

350
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:36,723
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

351
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:39,017
Human heads, they leave.

352
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:43,313
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

353
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:45,899
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

354
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:50,737
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

355
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:53,823
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

356
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:56,659
You just do your time
like a good boy...

357
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:59,829
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

358
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,789
...in a couple of years.

359
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:22,060
I went online to this fantastic...

360
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:25,188
...real estate website for D.C.

361
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:30,193
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

362
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,445
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

363
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:35,698
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

364
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:38,117
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there-

365
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:45,500
Apologise.

366
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,254
What?

367
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:55,927
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologise.

368
00:31:58,972 --> 00:32:01,724
For?
-You know perfectly well, Marie.

369
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,936
Well, obviously I don't-
-Your lies.

370
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:06,729
To me.

371
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,275
The shoplifting.

372
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,068
All of it.

373
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:16,739
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

374
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:20,034
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it-

375
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,078
Apologise.

376
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,584
Now or never. I mean it.

377
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,253
Or it'll never be the same.

378
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:36,050
Why are you punishing me?

379
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:43,349
If you don't respect me enough to
apologise, to tell me the truth, then-

380
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:54,277
I need my sister back.

381
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,959
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,298
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:29,479
What, do you want the gory details?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,481
No, you don't.

385
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:33,566
Keep you up at night.

386
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:39,447
So was it scary?

387
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:42,200
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

388
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:43,451
Jesus.

389
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,538
But you were way faster than him.

390
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,123
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

391
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,043
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

392
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,586
Kick ass and take names.

393
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:56,589
Son.
-No, it's fine.

394
00:33:57,674 --> 00:33:59,634
You know what it is?

395
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:03,513
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

396
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,640
I mean, you don't think about it.

397
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:08,518
You stomp them down.

398
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,688
Where do they come from?

399
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:15,775
Criminals, like the one you...

400
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:19,696
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

401
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:24,367
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

402
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:29,789
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

403
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,378
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

404
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:49,304
Cops.

405
00:36:49,804 --> 00:36:51,598
Cops!

406
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,658
Wasn't sure it was you.

407
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:53,910
New car?

408
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:57,914
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

409
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:01,251
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

410
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,385
Your half.

411
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:13,054
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

412
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:18,309
You're welcome.

413
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:19,561
Jesus.

414
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,232
Help me understand the math,
okay?

415
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,317
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

416
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:29,445
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

417
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,447
$1,000 each.

418
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,575
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

419
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:38,621
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

420
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,791
Sixteen. Not 15.

421
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,794
Something came up.

422
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:47,630
Something came up?

423
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,925
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

424
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:55,722
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

425
00:38:57,515 --> 00:39:00,476
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed-

426
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:06,024
Or rather you got robbed.
-but it doesn't matter.

427
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:09,736
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

428
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:11,654
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

429
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,823
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

430
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:17,118
It's the cost of business, yo.

431
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:18,786
You're sweating me over a grand?

432
00:39:18,995 --> 00:39:23,416
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

433
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,877
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

434
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:29,172
...is just you making a fool
of yourself.

435
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:32,217
I've got another technical
term for you.

436
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:35,178
Non-sustainable business model.

437
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:37,639
You're focusing on the negative.

438
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:41,434
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

439
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:44,479
What happens when
word gets out...

440
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:48,107
...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

441
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:51,236
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Pinkman...

442
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:55,532
...drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity.

443
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,033
Man, come on.

444
00:39:57,242 --> 00:40:00,703
You think Tuco had breakage?

445
00:40:01,704 --> 00:40:03,540
I guess it's true, he did.

446
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:04,874
He broke bones.

447
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:09,045
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

448
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:11,756
You want another grand?
Is that it?

449
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:14,217
That's not my point.
-Take it. Here.

450
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:20,974
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

451
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:23,351
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

452
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,187
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

453
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:27,730
So am I.

454
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:30,650
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

455
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,736
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

456
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:36,823
You've made
the division of labour very clear.

457
00:40:38,283 --> 00:40:41,703
Yo, I mean, seriously...

458
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:45,415
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

459
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,651
Hey.

460
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,111
Sorry.

461
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,071
Wow, you snuck in.

462
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,365
Didn't even know you were home.

463
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:21,701
What you eating?

464
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,954
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

465
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:27,874
I thought we nixed those, huh?

466
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:29,792
Did we?

467
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:35,465
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

468
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:38,176
I had a craving.

469
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:40,553
Once in a while is no big deal.

470
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:48,269
So where's Jr.?

471
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:50,438
Out.

472
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:53,983
With whom?

473
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:55,652
Louis.

474
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,741
Out where?

475
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:06,162
Somewhere. I don't know.

476
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:09,165
He'll be back by 9.
-Okay.

477
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:14,712
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

478
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:16,506
Why don't you?

479
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:22,011
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

480
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,639
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

481
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:27,100
Just pick up the phone like I do.

482
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:40,238
Great.

483
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:47,203
Perhaps you might know
something...

484
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:48,580
...about this.

485
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,501
Perhaps.

486
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,546
And then again...

487
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:59,799
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

488
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:03,469
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

489
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:08,558
I'd like an explanation, please.

490
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:11,644
You don't wanna go down that road.
-Why would you do this?

491
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:14,898
You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
-Three and a half cigarettes...

492
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:16,566
...won't do a thing to the baby.

493
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,902
Nothing.
-I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

494
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,696
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

495
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:27,869
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

496
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:33,791
Skyler, this-
I mean, this is something that-

497
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,253
This is so unlike you. Why-?
-Really?

498
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:39,380
How would you know?

499
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,219
No, thank you.

500
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:06,407
Hank.

501
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:36,145
Jesus.

502
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:20,190
Yo.

503
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:31,868
You asked me what
I want you to do.

504
00:45:42,128 --> 00:45:44,714
I want you to handle it.
