1
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:41,799
Yo.
-Yo.

2
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,259
What up?

3
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:44,594
Damn, bitch.

4
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:53,227
You got something for me?
-Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,361
Is this a five or an S?
-Five, yo.

6
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,446
No, wait. S.

7
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:07,533
No, no. Yeah, five.
-Yeah?

8
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,705
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:13,956
Hey, man.

10
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:17,210
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:20,171
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,881
Hey.

13
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,800
So they got names?

14
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:28,262
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

15
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,348
Him, they call Spooge.

16
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,770
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

17
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:37,897
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

18
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:40,066
...by a guy named Spooge?

19
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,901
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,697
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,533
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

22
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,910
Did I say that?
-Because I'll go do it myself.

23
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,415
It's just I'm on probation and all.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,292
So you gonna do it?

25
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,795
Yeah.

26
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,256
Good. Right on.

27
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:09,679
Because these two,
they need to get got.

28
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:43,064
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

29
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:45,149
Where's my-?

30
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:50,196
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

31
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:53,533
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

32
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,326
Where's my money?

33
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,954
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

34
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:00,289
Come on.

35
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:07,130
I will mess you up.

36
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:10,299
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,052
Your funeral, jack.

38
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:19,058
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,061
<i>Yeah, mucho loco.</i>

40
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,398
Do not test me.

41
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:37,535
Good morning.
-Good morning.

42
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,496
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,794
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,048
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:54,385
You have a great day.
-Right on. You too.

47
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:13,071
God. Shit.

48
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:49,273
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,113
Hello?

50
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:56,466
<i>Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...</i>

51
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,926
<i>...tonight in the steel knock out.</i>

52
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:02,055
<i>Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

53
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,599
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>

54
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,810
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only-</i>

55
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,772
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,566
<i>Now, Terry put this one together-</i>

57
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:16,361
Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,488
<i>-and I'm here to tell you-</i>

59
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:23,868
<i>Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...</i>

60
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,912
<i>Already done it.</i>

61
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,247
<i>Tonight, folks...</i>

62
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:38,591
<i>Do you realise how long it's been...</i>

63
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,388
<i>...since we've offered this sword
in this set?</i>

64
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:49,936
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.</i>

65
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,813
<i>It's no wonder-</i>

66
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,108
<i>It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now-</i>

67
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:56,442
What's your name?

68
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,946
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm-</i>

69
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:03,616
My name's Diesel.

70
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,785
<i>-eleven, 12, 13-</i>

71
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:10,123
<i>-sixteen, 17, 18, 19...</i>

72
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,875
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:16,713
<i>Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?</i>

74
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:21,092
<i>Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.</i>

75
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,262
<i>Folks, custom pieces-</i>

76
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:33,896
<i>Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...</i>

77
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:36,357
<i>...but there's a reason for that.</i>

78
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:41,821
<i>Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.</i>

79
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,658
<i>These knives possess edges like...</i>

80
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,755
So when are your folks
coming home?

81
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:03,343
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,181
I'm hungry.

83
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,355
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

84
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:18,358
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

85
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:23,529
<i>We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...</i>

86
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,866
<i>Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.</i>

87
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,911
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

88
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:35,958
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...</i>

89
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,211
<i>...calling to say hello.</i>

90
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:41,547
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...</i>

91
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,007
<i>...hoping everything's well.</i>

92
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,302
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...</i>

93
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:49,013
<i>...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

94
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,391
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

95
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,229
<i>-Hello?
-Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

96
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:59,899
<i>This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

97
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:02,235
No. No, not at all.

98
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:04,904
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:06,489
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

100
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:11,202
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

101
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,747
<i>...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

102
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:16,833
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

103
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,002
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:21,587
That's wonderful.

105
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:26,634
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

106
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,763
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,224
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant...</i>

108
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,103
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

109
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:40,106
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just-

110
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:45,737
<i>-What? What is it?
-I can't...</i>

111
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,449
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,911
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

113
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,749
It saved us.

114
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,837
I don't know if I...

115
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,798
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:08,217
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:11,888
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:14,766
So I just...

119
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:19,228
...finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,234
<i>Anyway...</i>

121
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:27,862
End of speech.

122
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,740
So I do-
I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:35,828
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,875
<i>-How about this afternoon?
-Yeah, okay.</i>

125
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:47,173
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

126
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:50,968
...trienes, polyenes.

127
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,639
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,891
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

129
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,352
...and you will...

130
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,690
...just keep in mind
that one element...

131
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:06,150
...carbon.

132
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,862
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

133
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:13,825
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,536
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

135
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:23,668
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

136
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,504
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,676
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,887
No. Okay.

139
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,516
I like to think of it...

140
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,021
I like to think that the diamond...

141
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,273
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

142
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:48,693
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

143
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:54,866
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,411
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:02,331
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,628
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:12,759
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

148
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,386
..for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,764
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

150
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:23,144
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

151
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:28,066
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

152
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,861
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,033
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:44,457
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,962
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:03,101
Anyway...

157
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:07,438
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

158
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,190
...paid to a carbon-based man...

159
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,071
...for something
he made out of carbon.

160
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:18,783
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

161
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,829
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:27,542
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,004
And then there's the hair thing.
-I actually like that.

164
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:33,506
That's a great look for you.

165
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:40,930
But you're feeling good?
-Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,307
It's...

167
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,976
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:50,064
I'm glad to... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,275
We're happy too.

170
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,154
And I just...

171
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:02,326
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

172
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,375
Is everything okay?

173
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:15,757
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

174
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:20,720
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

175
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,848
You know, completely confidential.

176
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,975
Okay?

177
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:33,232
See you tomorrow, Flynn.
-See you, Jeffrey.

178
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:36,986
Oh, man.

179
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,417
Let me see it.

180
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,506
Dad, let me see it.
-Don't worry about it.

181
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:03,054
Hey, let's go.

182
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:39,132
<i>Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...</i>

183
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:42,468
Hey.

184
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,597
Peekaboo.

185
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,145
No?

186
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,568
Peekaboo.

187
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:04,157
Oh, man.

188
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,328
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:14,417
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:18,004
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

191
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:21,090
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

192
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:29,307
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,280
Shut up!
-You shut up.

194
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,908
You shut up, you-
-You shut up!

195
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,827
You're the one who dropped it.
-I didn't drop it.

196
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,037
I didn't drop-

197
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:53,456
Shit! You dropped it.
-Shut the hell up about it.

198
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,041
You shut up!
-You shut up.

199
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,713
Get up.

200
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:06,386
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:30,034
You know who might have done it?
-I have an idea.

202
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,415
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:40,086
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

204
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:45,466
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

205
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:51,055
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,726
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:58,146 --> 00:18:59,814
You with me?

208
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,944
Scorpions?

209
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:10,116
Scorpions are good.

210
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,410
Yeah.

211
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,294
Nice.

212
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,978
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

213
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,773
Who is this?

214
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,670
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:06,005
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

216
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:08,591
Mom.
-What? I'm just offering the choice.

217
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,302
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

218
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,472
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
-Nice to meet you too.

219
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,848
Oh, Walt.

220
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,477
Look who's here.

221
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,687
Gretchen.
-Hi.

222
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:23,940
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

223
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:26,693
Look at you. You're looking good.

224
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:28,903
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

225
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:30,613
I know it was for me.

226
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:34,409
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

227
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,993
May I?
-Oh, sure.

228
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:39,414
For good luck, right?
-Exactly. Here's hoping.

229
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,249
We could use some of that.
-Yeah.

230
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:45,712
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:51,718
It was a really good thing.
-You're very welcome.

232
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:55,054
We're gonna find a way to repay you.
-No, no, no.

233
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:58,391
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,729
You know, I hate to say it...

235
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:06,065
...but I really need to get going.

236
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:07,900
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,153
You can't stay for dinner?
-I wish I could...

238
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,698
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

239
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:14,907
Okay. Okay.

240
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:19,912
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

241
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,414
Yeah, hopefully.

242
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:24,459
Gretchen, your purse.

243
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,546
Well, good to see you.

244
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:33,509
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

245
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:38,014
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

246
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:40,350
It's so good to see you.
-And you.

247
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,479
Nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

248
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:48,566
Okay. Bye, now.
-Drive safely.

249
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:53,196
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

250
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:55,239
I'll be right back.

251
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,745
Gretchen.

252
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:02,747
Hey.

253
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,296
Hey.
-Hey yourself.

254
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,340
What did you...?

255
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,719
We need to talk.

256
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:20,973
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

257
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:25,228
Please. Please.

258
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,080
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

259
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:48,418
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

260
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:51,963
I just wanna say, man-
-What? What do you wanna say?

261
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,673
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:57,260
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,762
Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
-Shut up!

264
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:01,764
Jesus.

265
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:05,309
Serious, I might have a concussion.
-Don't fall asleep, baby.

266
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,437
Subdural hematoma.
-Don't fall asleep.

267
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:10,189
Shut up.

268
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,525
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:15,111
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

270
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,529
Do it!

271
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:23,036
All right, turn around.

272
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:24,495
Turn around.

273
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:27,290
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

274
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:36,049
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,522
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any-

276
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,399
We shot it all.
-Yeah?

277
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:56,903
Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
-Yeah.

278
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,238
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,242
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

280
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:07,413
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

281
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:09,540
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,754
There you go.

283
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:19,967
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:24,180
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:25,431
Division of labour.

286
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,812
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,106
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:35,733
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,819
You shut up.
-You shut up, skank.

290
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,863
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:44,742
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

292
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:48,454
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:51,833
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

294
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,836
...for being such a pussy.

295
00:24:57,338 --> 00:25:00,800
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:04,887
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,853
All right.

298
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:15,481
You two are never
getting high again.

299
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,276
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:21,154
Not another needle,
not another ball...

301
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:25,408
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

302
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:29,662
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

303
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:33,041
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:34,751
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,462
Where?
-Back yard.

306
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,298
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

307
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,676
Hurting. Painful.
-Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:47,597
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:50,808
Hey, don't move.

310
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,855
Come on.

311
00:25:58,274 --> 00:25:59,525
See?

312
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:02,987
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:06,032
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,034
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:11,204
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:13,706
Get high.

317
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:19,587
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:22,006
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,717
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:26:25,426 --> 00:26:26,469
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

321
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:28,971
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

322
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,683
<i>In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

323
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:35,186
<i>What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumbass?</i>

324
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,563
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

325
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:40,108
<i>All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

326
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,568
<i>-Nobody even noticed.
-Nobody noticed?</i>

327
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:47,448
<i>-For real?
-I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

328
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,665
Oh, my God.

329
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,752
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:05,423
It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
-You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:08,050
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,428
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:12,596
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,598
At least I got persistence.

335
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,685
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

336
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:22,440
Don't listen to that skank.
-Stop calling me that.

337
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,734
I ain't no skank!

338
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:27,278
Skank, skank, skank-
-Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:28,988
Sit, sit.

340
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:33,284
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:36,078
Now, chill.

342
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:39,582
You, get that thing open.

343
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,961
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,426
Where's the kid?

345
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,471
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,640
What are you asking me for?

347
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:16,494
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:17,953
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,959
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:28,881
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,634
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:34,512
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,180
Are you serious?

354
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:39,517
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,102
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, Diesel...

356
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,188
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

357
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,775
Get out of the way.

358
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,611
Get out of the way!

359
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,837
So you didn't tell anyone.

360
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:11,424
You didn't tell Elliott.
-Not yet.

361
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:15,886
Well, what does that mean?
-That means exactly what it means.

362
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:19,390
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,396
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:26,731
All right.

365
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:32,236
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

366
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:34,405
This was...

367
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:38,451
This entire thing was unfortunate.

368
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,911
Unfortunate?

369
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:45,458
And I apologise deeply.

370
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,585
Thank you.

371
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:52,423
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:58,012
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:02,266
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,605
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

375
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:09,273
...how are you paying for it?

376
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:14,236
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

377
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:17,615
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:20,534
You tell your wife and son...

379
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:22,953
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:25,790
Why are you doing this?

381
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,461
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,881
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

383
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,716
...thanking me for saving your life.

384
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:40,012
Why would you do that to her?
-As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:44,934
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

386
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,143
All right?

387
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,979
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

388
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:51,649
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

389
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:56,904
I don't owe you an explanation.

390
00:30:57,113 --> 00:31:00,741
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologised.

391
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,744
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

392
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:06,914
There. I've apologised twice now.

393
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:10,001
I'm humbly sorry.

394
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:11,669
Three times.

395
00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:13,838
Let me just get this straight.

396
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:16,424
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

397
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,092
...no strings attached.

398
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,511
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

399
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,389
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

400
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:28,019
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

401
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:30,062
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

402
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,273
...you involve us in your lie.

403
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:38,362
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:44,327
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:49,206
What happened to you?

406
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,211
Really, Walt.

407
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,213
What happened?

408
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:59,216
Because this isn't you.

409
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:06,140
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

410
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:10,770
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

411
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:13,314
That I should go begging
for your charity?

412
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:17,360
And you waving
your chequebook around...

413
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:21,113
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

414
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:22,448
...how you and Elliott-

415
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:25,743
How you and Elliott cut me out?

416
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:27,745
What? That can't be how you see it.

417
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:31,415
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

418
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,542
That cannot be how you see it.

419
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,670
Good. That's beautifully done.
-You left-

420
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:37,672
You are always
the picture of innocence.

421
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,424
You left me.
-The picture of innocence.

422
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:44,178
Just sweetness and light.
-You left me.

423
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,263
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

424
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:49,600
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

425
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:52,395
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

426
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,272
What? Did I dream all of that?

427
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:57,983
That's your excuse...

428
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:00,986
...to build your little empire
on my work?

429
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:03,447
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

430
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:06,701
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

431
00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:09,620
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

432
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,628
I don't even know what to say to you.

433
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:21,382
I don't even know where to begin.

434
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:32,018
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:37,148
Fuck you.

436
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,685
Hey.

437
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,275
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:36,624
Hey.

439
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:02,316
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,194
No, what are you doing?

441
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:09,615
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:11,492
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:15,246
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:17,373
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,336
Bedtime.

446
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,634
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,267
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,352
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:41,230
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,066
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,099
Oh, hey.

452
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,727
Should I ask where you've been?

453
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:22,563
Never mind.

454
00:36:22,772 --> 00:36:25,775
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:28,694
Skyler.

456
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,245
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,341
Walt.

458
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,511
We need to talk.

459
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,149
Just say it.

460
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:19,829
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,552
What did she say, exactly?

462
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:41,892
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:45,938
She said something like:

464
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,360
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

465
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,157
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:37:56,365 --> 00:37:59,452
I wish you the very best."

467
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:03,497
And that was it.

468
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,755
Yeah.

469
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:15,676
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,803
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,514
I was so stunned, but...

472
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:25,644
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

473
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:36,864
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:44,622
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

475
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,459
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

476
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:51,962
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,760
Walt.

478
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,471
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:07,812
Where were you tonight?

480
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:11,273
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:15,194
I was with Gretchen.

482
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:18,656
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,412
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

484
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,498
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:30,835
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

486
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:32,920
...and beating around the bush-

487
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:37,008
Okay, what-? Tell us what?

488
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:40,511
Well...

489
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:43,514
There was a lot of...

490
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:47,184
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

491
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:52,940
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

492
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:55,109
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:59,655
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

494
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:05,119
They're broke.

495
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:08,706
You are kidding me.
-No.

496
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:12,293
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:17,131
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

498
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,009
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

499
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,055
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

500
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:27,099
That is-

501
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:30,978
Jesus, that's...

502
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,733
Yeah.

503
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:52,083
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:57,254
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:01,509
Listen.

506
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:05,221
Not to sound selfish...

507
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:08,432
...but as far as we go...

508
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:12,103
...we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:19,068
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:20,778
Hey.

511
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:29,578
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

512
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,747
Okay.

513
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:44,343
And yet...

514
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:48,681
...she still drives a Bentley.

515
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:57,982
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,331
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:17,251
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,254
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:42:20,463 --> 00:42:21,922
Nowhere.

520
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:25,051
I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:27,345
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,680
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

523
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:34,602
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

524
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,104
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:40,316
I need to... I need to even out.

526
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,736
Let me get a hit of that crystal.
-Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:45,237
Come on, baby.

528
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:48,449
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:42:48,658 --> 00:42:52,578
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,622
I ain't no skank.

531
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:59,210
I would appreciate an apology.

532
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:03,964
What?

533
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:06,884
I am trying to take
the high road here.

534
00:43:07,093 --> 00:43:08,427
Are you gonna do right?

535
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:09,720
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:13,432
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:17,395
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

538
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:21,107
...and assist me and shut up.

539
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:26,737
I ain't no skank.

540
00:43:26,946 --> 00:43:28,906
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

541
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,576
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

542
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,578
You listening to me, skank?

543
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:36,455
You hear me, skank?

544
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:40,751
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

545
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,839
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

546
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:48,217
I ain't no skank.

547
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,012
No, no, no. Don't. No.

548
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:10,114
I ain't no skank.

549
00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:11,175
<i>911.</i>

550
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:26,941
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

551
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:30,361
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:33,280
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:35,700
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:39,370
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

555
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:53,718
Here you go.

556
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:58,556
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

557
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:02,393
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

558
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:07,398
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

559
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:10,526
You stay right here. Okay?

560
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:21,037
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.
