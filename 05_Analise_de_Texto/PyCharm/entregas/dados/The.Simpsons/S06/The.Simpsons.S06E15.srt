1
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:08,266
Homie the Clown

2
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:55,277
When Krusty wants to,
he can still blow them away.

3
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:58,652
Yes. He can take a simple,
everyday thing like eating a bicycle...

4
00:00:58,822 --> 00:00:59,985
...and make it funny.

5
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:01,699
See you tomorrow, kids.

6
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:06,700
But before I go, I'd just like to say...

7
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,707
There's nothing better
than a cigarette...

8
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:20,421
...unless it's a cigarette
lit with a $ 100 bill.

9
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:25,178
Put 5000 bucks on the Lakers. Hire
Kenny G to play for me in the elevator.

10
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:27,757
My house is dirty. Buy me a clean one.

11
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:30,990
Krusty, as your accountant,
I must warn you...

12
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,551
Did you send 1000 roses...

13
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,806
...to Bea Arthur's grave?
- Yes. But she's...

14
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,856
I don't wanna hear
the end of sentences.

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,147
George Carlin on three.

16
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,106
Yeah. Lawsuit? Oh, come on.

17
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:42,315
My "Seven Words
You Can't Say on TV" bit...

18
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:45,860
...was entirely different from your bit.

19
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:51,369
So I'm a thief, am I?
Well, excuse me!

20
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,826
- Give him 10 grand.
- Steve Martin on four.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,663
Ten grand.

22
00:01:55,838 --> 00:02:00,464
Krusty, in regards to the large wager
you made on yesterday's horse race...

23
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:04,294
Come on. How about letting me go
double or nothing on the opera tonight.

24
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,550
- Who do you like?
- The tenor.

25
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,638
Okay. But we're only
letting the bet ride...

26
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,594
...because you crack us
so consistently up.

27
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:17,600
You've got to stop blowing
your money like this, Krusty.

28
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,735
No can do.

29
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,736
And those ridiculous bets you make.

30
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:26,401
Gambling is the finest thing
a person can do if he's good at it.

31
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:29,822
- You haven't won anything in months.
- So I'll just make more money.

32
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:33,330
- Crank out some merchandise.
- You already merchandised everything.

33
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,952
Krusty's Monopoly game,
the Krusty Crowd-Control Barrier.

34
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:40,255
Nothing is selling anymore.
Not even your new Lady Krusty line.

35
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:43,176
But our infomercials are running
24 hours a day.

36
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:48,593
So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty
Mustache-Removal System, Angelique?

37
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,387
It's Krusterrific, Johnny Unitas.

38
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,265
But is my upper lip
supposed to bleed like this?

39
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:55,553
Probably.

40
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:59,640
At this rate, you'll be broke in a month.
Only thing left to do is...

41
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:02,700
...to open a clown college
and train some regional Krustys.

42
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:04,526
You mean like that bozo,
Bonko the Clown?

43
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,358
- Exactly.
- Forget it.

44
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,941
I'll just cut back
on the condor-egg omelets.

45
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:11,868
A couple of those
would be tasty right now.

46
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,658
I'll found the college tomorrow.

47
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:24,480
It must be the first of the month.
New Billboard Day!

48
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,556
Finders, keepers.

49
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,888
"This year, give her English muffins."

50
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,141
Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.

51
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:46,776
"Best in the West."

52
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,492
That rhymes.

53
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:55,824
Clown college. You can't eat that.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,870
I got everything
I was supposed to get.

55
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,667
I'm not going to enroll
in that clown college, though.

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,588
That advertisement had
no effect on me whatsoever.

57
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,230
Hey, Homer. The section you're
supposed to be monitoring is on fire.

58
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,159
Clowns are funny.

59
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,293
- Mom?
- I think I'll have some wine.

60
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,345
- Marge?
- Yes, Homie.

61
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,979
That's it. You people have
stood in my way long enough.

62
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,181
I'm going to clown college.

63
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,892
I don't think any of us
expected him to say that.

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,444
Hurry up.
It's my first day of clown college.

65
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:16,370
- Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm.
- I am holding still. I am squirming.

66
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,988
Dad, you can't go around
pretending to be Krusty.

67
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,116
It's sacrilege. He's a one and only.
I mean, he invented the pie fight...

68
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,470
...the pratfall and the seltzer bottle,
as far as I know.

69
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:29,999
Yeah, Dad. It was bad enough when you
tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley.

70
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,715
- But Krusty...
- You didn't complain when I got you...

71
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,679
...this close to Chachi.

72
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,350
What's a chachi?

73
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:44,726
All right. Now, there can only be
one Krusty in each territory.

74
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:48,227
So I hope this works out.
Tell me where you're from.

75
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,774
- Georgia.
- Texas.

76
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:52,656
- Brooklyn.
- Russia.

77
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,658
- New Hampshire.
- Homer.

78
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:58,240
Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...
Wha...?

79
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:01,242
Those are supposed to be
baggy pants. Baggy!

80
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:06,629
I've never had a pair of pants
that fit this well in my life.

81
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,124
Okay. Memorize these
funny place names:

82
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:14,721
Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga...

83
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:16,632
...Seattle.

84
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,580
Stop it. You're killing me.

85
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:23,223
Seattle.

86
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:32,897
And now, everybody's favorite,
the Spin-Cycle Fantastic trick.

87
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,606
It's a great piece of buffoonery
if you pull it off.

88
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,785
But if you blow it,
you'll look like a fool.

89
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,204
Steady. Steady.

90
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,715
Now, when the wealthy dowager
comes in, the party's over, right?

91
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,211
Wrong.

92
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,843
"Kill wealthy dowager."

93
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:04,932
Burn that seat.

94
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,638
These Krusty-brand balloons
are 3 bucks each.

95
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:10,734
Get a cheap one, and what happens?
Goes off!

96
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:14,770
Takes out the eyeballs of every kid in
the room. What's that gonna cost you?

97
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,610
Hey, Bill. What did that cost us?

98
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,386
I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad.

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,934
If there has to be a bastardized version
of Krusty, I'm glad it's you.

100
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,190
Thanks, honey. Bank shot!

101
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:51,434
- That's good aim, Dad.
- Well, it was my major.

102
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:55,317
Welcome to the noble family
of skilled Krustaceans.

103
00:07:55,531 --> 00:08:00,406
You'll now go back to your hometowns
and do kids' parties, swap meets...

104
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:05,320
...and the other piddling crap I wouldn't
touch with a 10-foot clown pole.

105
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,621
Now come and get your catskins...

106
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,287
I mean, sheepskins.

107
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,666
This is the happiest day of my life...

108
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:21,799
Got it. No shock for me.

109
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,219
Oh, yeah?

110
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,710
And now, to help introduce our fantastic
new burger, the one with ketchup...

111
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:46,362
...here he is, coming in by parachute,
Krusty the Clown.

112
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:10,682
"To audience. I now proclaim
this new burger for sale."

113
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,699
Lord, save me.

114
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,741
It's the Krusty Burglar.

115
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,617
Oh, my God.
He's stealing all the burgers.

116
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:33,831
Why, you little...

117
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,627
Homer. Homer, it's all just an act.

118
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:42,132
Stop. Stop.

119
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:44,380
He's already dead.

120
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:46,425
- Sir. Sir.
- I gotta get him.

121
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,929
Get him.

122
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,971
Krusty the Clown, everybody.

123
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,519
Please look at my
MedicAlert bracelet.

124
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:09,904
Hey, hey.

125
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:15,327
And then take that and...

126
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,499
...put that in there and...

127
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,468
...here's your giraffe, little girl.
- I'm a boy.

128
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:24,168
That's the spirit. Never give up.

129
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:27,510
Well, I guess you're pretty
impressed, huh, Bart?

130
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:31,388
My dad got Krusty the Clown
to personally appear at my party.

131
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:34,183
I have a feeling I could get him
to appear at my house.

132
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,399
I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty
big wheel down at the cracker factory.

133
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,321
It's not 5:30 yet.

134
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,175
- Hey, nice threads.
- I'm beat.

135
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:07,840
And after work, I gotta dedicate a new
Jiffy Lube and cohost the ACE Awards.

136
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,472
- Wow, Jiffy Lube.
- Boy, you're running yourself ragged.

137
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:17,240
Yeah. When I started this clown thing,
I thought it would be nothing but glory.

138
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:19,937
You know,
the glory of being a clown.

139
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:23,604
I tell you, it's hard, tiring work.

140
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:27,442
But when I see the smiles
on their little faces...

141
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:31,290
...I just know they're getting ready
to jab me with something.

142
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,915
Well, my time's almost up here.
So I'd like to say I know Woody Allen.

143
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,299
And now, the winner for the most
promising new series on cable:

144
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,340
Old Starsky and Hutch's.

145
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:53,700
Accepting the award is the son
of the guy who played Huggy Bear.

146
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,975
Let's walk and talk. I have wonderful
stories about other famous people...

147
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:05,652
...that include me in some way.
- Can't. Gotta distract bulls at a rodeo.

148
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,531
Hey, me too. We can go together.

149
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,489
No. I'm going a different way
than you, Dick.

150
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:14,747
Your churlish attitude reminds me of the
time I had dinner with Groucho and...

151
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,160
You're gonna have dinner with
Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.

152
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:26,168
Being a clown sucks. Kicked by kids,
bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly.

153
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:29,546
Who am I clowning?
I have no business being a clown.

154
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:33,506
I'm leaving the clowning business to the
other clowns in the clowning business.

155
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,679
Oh, no.

156
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:38,475
Well, well, well, velocity boy.

157
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,847
I'm gonna give you
the biggest ticket you...

158
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,602
Hey, Krusty!

159
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,861
- I'm not Krusty.
- To think I was gonna give you a ticket.

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,188
- Krusty the Clown.
- I am not Krusty.

161
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:51,277
Hey, Krusty, Krusty. You remember
the time we got loaded...

162
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:54,322
...and set those beavers loose
in that pine-furniture store?

163
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,293
Memories.
All right, you take it easy, Krusty.

164
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,121
Hey, he didn't give me a ticket.

165
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:07,169
This is an intriguing development.

166
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:11,216
You mean I get 5 percent off everything
in the store just because I look like...

167
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:14,306
I mean, just because I am
Krusty the Clown?

168
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:18,990
How could I charge full price to the man
whose lust for filthy magazines...

169
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,761
...kept me in business during
that first shaky year?

170
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:24,391
Oh, by the way, here is your
new issue of Gigantic Asses.

171
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,394
I'm telling you, this'll work. They'll
think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff.

172
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:32,522
I've been getting free stuff all day.
Look at this swell bucket of house paint.

173
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:34,819
- Look at it.
- I'm not saying it won't work.

174
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:38,993
- I'm just saying it's dishonest.
- If we agree, then why are we arguing?

175
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,000
Hey, Krusty, hey.
Beautiful date tonight, huh?

176
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,669
And such lovely children
you have now.

177
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:51,750
- I'm more striking than lovely.
- You come with me. Come with Luigi.

178
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,846
You don't want to sit
with the rest of the scum.

179
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,344
- Hey.
- What's going on?

180
00:13:56,517 --> 00:14:00,265
I only consider you scum
compared to Krusty.

181
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:03,272
- Well, I can see that.
- Yeah, you see how you scum.

182
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,404
Let me get this straight. You took
money made franchising your name...

183
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,780
...and bet it against
the Harlem Globetrotters?

184
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,703
Oh, I thought the Generals were due.

185
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:24,420
He's spinning the ball on his finger.
Just take it. Take the ball.

186
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,173
That game was fixed. They were using
a freaking ladder, for God's sake.

187
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,128
I am afraid the time
has come for you to pay us.

188
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:38,170
Look, I'm cleaned out.
Just take the clown college.

189
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,719
We have already taken it.

190
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,809
Kids have a lot of money these days.

191
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,763
So after you finish your performance,
you might consider robbing them.

192
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,688
What can I tell you?
You can't get blood from a turnip.

193
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:51,939
You wanna kill me,
go ahead and kill me.

194
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,532
Hey, all right, okay already.

195
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,784
- Look, we can talk this over.
- No more talk.

196
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:01,310
It is time for us
to take you for a ride.

197
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,790
Oh, no...

198
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,205
- Mind if I go to the bathroom first?
- I see no harm in that.

199
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,717
When he's done in there, I gotta go.

200
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:26,938
Okay, wherever Krusty's gone,
we'll find him.

201
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:30,891
Legs, you check out the East Side.
Louie, Rome and Budapest.

202
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,106
Tell the boys
I want a total world search.

203
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,610
- Right, boss.
- Right, boss.

204
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:42,242
I want a free car because I'm Krusty.
Krusty the Clown. Get it? Krusty.

205
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,874
Cancel the world search.

206
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:52,960
I want everything that's coming to
Krusty the Clown, which is me, Krusty.

207
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:55,917
Hey, it's Krusty, all right.

208
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:59,464
Should I shoot him
gangland-style or execution-style?

209
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,758
Listen to your heart.

210
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,428
Well, I can't
give you the car, Krusty.

211
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:09,990
But I can let you have this little number
for practically nothing. Only $38,000.

212
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:12,401
Hey, what are all these holes?

213
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,479
Speed holes.
They make the car go faster.

214
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:17,324
Oh, yeah. Speed holes.

215
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:23,310
You want my advice?
I think you should buy this car.

216
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,406
We need more ammo.
Let's go to Big 5.

217
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:33,123
Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete.
Now, when I remove the bandages...

218
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,626
...don't be alarmed by the total stranger
staring back at you.

219
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,837
I look exactly the same,
you moron!

220
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,887
Oh, nonsense, Krusty.
You look at least 10 years younger.

221
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,561
- Plus, I did your breasts.
- Hear me complaining about the breasts?

222
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:51,647
Oh, what's the use in hiding?

223
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:54,308
I gotta go back to Springfield
and face the music.

224
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:55,987
Can you loan me bus fare?

225
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,109
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

226
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,905
What you diddily doing, neighbor?

227
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,283
I'm putting speed holes
in my car. Makes it go faster.

228
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,350
Is that so? Well, gee, maybe the old
Flanders-mobile could use...

229
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:18,257
Wow, lucky I always keep a Bible
close to my heart...

230
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:26,218
Lucky I was wearing this extra-large
piece of the true cross today.

231
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,227
I think I'll go inside.

232
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,630
What keeps doing that?

233
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:36,580
I told you we should've bought more
than three bullets. Let's just grab him.

234
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,945
Hey!

235
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,110
But wait. You can't kill me
for being Krusty. I'm not him.

236
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,782
- I'm Homer Simpson.
- The same Homer Simpson who...

237
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,280
...crashed his car through the wall
of our club?

238
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:51,281
Actually, my name is Barney.
Yeah, Barney Gumble.

239
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,794
The same Barney Gumble
who keeps taking pictures of my sister?

240
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,749
Actually, my real name is...

241
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:59,125
Think, Krusty, think. Joe Valachi.

242
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:03,910
Same Joe Valachi who squealed to the
Senate committee about organized crime?

243
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,464
- Benedict Arnold.
- The same Benedict Arnold...

244
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,511
...who plotted to surrender
West Point to the hated British?

245
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:15,848
I am so glad I had
a chance to meet you...

246
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,694
...before we did this, Krusty,
because I am a great fan.

247
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,363
Don Vittorio Dimaggio.

248
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,242
Krusty the Clown.

249
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,366
Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.

250
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,456
I cannot do it.

251
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:38,746
To murder a funnyman
of such genius would be a crime.

252
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,210
Tell you what, Krusty.

253
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:45,881
Do for me my favorite trick, where you
ride the little bike through the loop...

254
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,757
...and I will let you live.
- But I've never been able to do the...

255
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,518
Hey, how about if I squirt you
in the face with my boutonnière? Okay.

256
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:59,160
- I'll never be able to do this trick. Never.
- Go. Go.

257
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,568
Hey. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

258
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:07,155
I'm the greatest clown in the world.

259
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,793
The fact that you did not do the trick
well is the biggest insult of all.

260
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,920
Hey, guys. I came to...

261
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,637
Oh, you got a deadly game of
cat and mouse going. I'll come back.

262
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:32,549
I'm seeing double here.
Four Krustys.

263
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,562
Krusty. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
You came here to save me.

264
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:40,266
Yeah. That's what I did.

265
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:45,611
My apologies to you. I almost
made a grievous error.

266
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:48,404
- Goodbye, Krusty.
- Wait.

267
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:52,367
He can't kill anybody if he doesn't
know which one's the real Krusty.

268
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:57,835
I am confused.

269
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,797
- Good one, Krusty.
- Oh, crap.

270
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,878
Because of that
disrespectful display...

271
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,258
...I shall now kill both of you.

272
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:13,930
Unless you both go
through the loop together.

273
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:25,529
I can't see, you idiot.
Take your hands off my eyes.

274
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,464
- Hey.
- Not bad.

275
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,843
Without the loop, it is nothing.

276
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,567
Yeah, Krustys!

277
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,985
Grazie. Grazie. You have brought
great joy to this old Italian stereotype.

278
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:17,710
- No, no, Don Vittorio. You're not...
- Yes, I am. I know it. I am.

279
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,390
- Anyway, thank you, Krusty.
- Oh, you're welcome.

280
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:25,121
- So we're even now, huh?
- No, we just won't kill you.

281
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,291
But you still owe us the money.

282
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,798
- Forty-eight dollars.
- Here's 50.

283
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,464
And 2, your change.
And we thank you.
