00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:07,553
Homer Badman

2
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:38,820
Damn FDA.
Why can't it all be marshmallow?

3
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,550
Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow
pieces back in the box.

4
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:43,717
They go in the trash.

5
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,848
You like sweets, kids?

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,681
I know a place that's sweeter
than sweetness itself.

7
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:52,223
In this sweet place,
earthly doughnuts are sour as poison.

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,893
You'd spit them out, you would.

9
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm talking about
the Candy Industry Trade Show.

10
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:01,897
How did you get tickets?

11
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:04,608
They hid them in every
millionth Krusty Klump Bar...

12
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,536
...and Krusty Klump Bar
with almonds.

13
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:12,453
Hey. Hey.

14
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,545
I have asked you nicely
not to mangle my merchandise.

15
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,632
You leave me no choice
but to ask you nicely again.

16
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:22,671
- Can I come to the candy show? Can I?
- No, me. Take me, me, me.

17
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:24,175
Sorry, kids.

18
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:27,681
But this the one event
I want my darling wife by my side.

19
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,598
0h, well, thank you, Homer.
But take one of the kids.

20
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,351
Marge, they can't carry enough candy.

21
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:37,230
They have puny little muscles.
Not big, ropy ones like you.

22
00:01:37,903 --> 00:01:42,565
- You go, Mom. For the greater good.
- For the greater good.

23
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:46,730
Homer, are all
these pockets necessary?

24
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:49,490
They wouldn't be if you would
sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.

25
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:53,407
Well, that's the babysitter. No one
in town will sit for you two anymore.

26
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,630
I had to choose between a grad student
at the university or a scary-looking hobo.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,212
Please, the hobo.
Please, the hobo. The hobo.

28
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,466
Hi. I'm Ashley Grant.

29
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:06,924
Ashley Grant. You gave a talk
on women's issues at my school...

30
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,590
...on how we don't have to
be second-class citizens.

31
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,259
Mom, how can you leave us
with this maniac?

32
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,644
Hurry. If we're early,
we can get a picture...

33
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:16,642
...with the two surviving Musketeers.

34
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,901
There's also a baby
somewhere upstairs.

35
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:25,399
So you're one of those
"don't-call-me-a-chick" chicks, huh?

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,402
Sorry about
my unenlightened brother.

37
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,785
He will make
the next few hours a living hell.

38
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,331
Oh, I don't know.

39
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,207
See this, Bart?

40
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,836
Disemboweler IV.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,871
The game where condemned criminals
dig at each other with rusty hooks.

42
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:44,297
Do a little housework
and you can play for five minutes.

43
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,385
No way.

44
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,141
- Yes.
- See, Lisa? Male's aren't hard to tame.

45
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,224
They all follow their video cartridges.

46
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,528
Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.

47
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,369
The front desk
is looking for Mr. Goodbar.

48
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:12,661
I feel like a kid
in some kind of a store.

49
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,370
Brilliant.

50
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:19,790
Exquisite.

51
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,707
You'll do well. Give me those.

52
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:26,422
Well, as you can see,
I have created a lemon ball so sour...

53
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:29,762
...it can only be safely contained
in a magnetic field.

54
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:33,389
The candy, known as 77X42...

55
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,604
- Where the hell is the candy?
- I don't know.

56
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,892
Hey, sir. Try our wax lips.

57
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,896
- It's the candy of 1000 uses.
- Like what?

58
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:45,947
One, a humorous substitute
for your own lips.

59
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:49,319
- Keep going.
- Two...

60
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:51,659
I'm needed in the basement.

61
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:09,336
You're gonna have to put some sugar
on that celery or get out, ma'am.

62
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:15,970
Gummi bears. Gummi calves' heads.

63
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:18,814
Gummi jawbreakers.

64
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,484
- What's that?
- That is the rarest gummi of them all.

65
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,984
The gummi Venus de Milo,
carved by gummi artisans...

66
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:34,865
...who work exclusively
in the medium of gummi.

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,245
Will you two stop saying
"gummi" so much?

68
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,452
Must have rare gummi.
Distract the salesman.

69
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,129
No. I won't make a spectacle
out of myself any further.

70
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,718
How did they get there?

71
00:04:56,393 --> 00:05:00,940
Now, this is going to take all my skill.

72
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,566
- Halt! Halt!
- Run, Marge. Save the booty.

73
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,438
After him. He has the gummi.

74
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:24,810
See you in hell, candy boy!

75
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,801
Lis, I found a big caramel deposit
on her back.

76
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm coming.

77
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,317
Wait a minute. Wait.
Where's my gummi de Milo?

78
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,231
Okay, don't panic. She can't
have gotten far. She has no arms.

79
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:55,780
I'm sure it'll turn up.

80
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:59,156
Take the babysitter home now.
She's been in the car for 20 minutes.

81
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:02,747
Relax, Marge.
There's plenty for her to do in there.

82
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:05,831
See? She's having the time of her life.

83
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,340
So a graduate student, huh?

84
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:12,758
How come you can go to the moon,
but can't make my shoes smell good?

85
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,837
- I'm sorry?
- Nobody's blaming you.

86
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,805
Could you take the wheel
for a second?

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,764
- I have to scratch in two places at once.
- Just drop me off here.

88
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,774
Precious Venus.

89
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,941
Thank you.

90
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,827
Hey, kids.
Lots of candy left for breakfast.

91
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,924
Why don't we give it
to some needy children then?

92
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,133
The candy conventioneers
tracked us down.

93
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:06,160
There he is. There's the man
that sexually harassed me.

94
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,815
For a minute there I thought
I was in big trouble. It's just a...

95
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:16,866
Two, four, six, eight
Homer's crime was very great

96
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:21,198
"Great" meaning "large or immense"
We use it in the pejorative sense

97
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,954
Marge, I swear I didn't touch her.
You know how bashful I am.

98
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,123
I can't even say the word "titmouse"
without giggling like a schoolgirl.

99
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,501
At any rate, I believe you.

100
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:35,212
I think you should go outside
and straighten this out.

101
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:38,550
Some of their chants
are very catchy and memorable.

102
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:43,135
- You grabbed me in the car.
- Oh, that? No.

103
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,644
I was grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo
that got stuck to your pants.

104
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:50,639
Yeah, right.
That's the oldest excuse in the book.

105
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:53,270
Come on. I'm a decent guy.

106
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:02,453
Why would anybody
wanna touch a girl's butt?

107
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,281
That's where cooties come from.

108
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,698
I don't understand.
What is she saying you did?

109
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,871
Lisa, remember that postcard
Grampa sent us from Florida...

110
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,334
...of that alligator
biting that woman's bottom?

111
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:15,175
Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.

112
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,667
That's right.
We all thought it was hilarious.

113
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,588
But it turns out we were wrong.

114
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:22,681
That alligator was
sexually harassing that woman.

115
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:24,967
And the dog in the Coppertone ad?
Same deal?

116
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:26,845
Well, that's kind of a gray area.

117
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,732
- We know you're innocent, Dad.
- Thanks, kids.

118
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,274
They seem to be building some
sort of a shantytown.

119
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:43,529
Do your worst, protestors.
You can't stop me from living my life.

120
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,300
- No respect for women. No peace.
- Try to push the right buttons now.

121
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,699
We ain't crazy about
nuclear power either!

122
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,705
You people aren't allowed in here.

123
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,584
It's okay. They're with me.

124
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,885
They're ruining my whole life.

125
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,384
Marge, please,
this is where I need you the most.

126
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:11,144
I'm counting on you to do something
or say something to make it all better.

127
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:14,185
- Okay. Go.
- Homer...

128
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:18,152
I talked to the indignation coordinator
out on the lawn today.

129
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,694
I said you were a decent man.
She wouldn't listen.

130
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:24,200
Besides standing by you and
supporting you, there's nothing I can do.

131
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,196
You mean, I'm on my own?

132
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,323
I've never been on my own. Oh, no.

133
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,959
On own. On own.
I need help. Oh, God, help me.

134
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,661
Help me, God!

135
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:44,262
- Hello?
- Hello, Homer, this is God...

136
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,302
...frey Jones from
the TV magazine show Rock Bottom.

137
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,767
We're aware of your problems,
and, Mr. Simpson, we want to help.

138
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:57,149
I saw that report you did on Sasquatch.
It was fair and even-handed.

139
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,648
I'll do it.

140
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:01,210
Somebody had to take
the babysitter home.

141
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:05,243
Then I noticed she was sitting on the
gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her.

142
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:10,405
Oh, just thinking about
that sweet, sweet candy...

143
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:15,618
I just wish I had
another one right now.

144
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:18,832
- But the most important thing is...
- That was great, Mr. Simpson.

145
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,627
- We got everything we need.
- Okay.

146
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,430
Say, can you introduce me
to the Sasquatch?

147
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,762
I like his style.

148
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,146
Here comes the bouncing ball
of justice.

149
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,890
Tonight on Rock Bottom:

150
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,605
We go undercover at a sex farm
for sex hookers.

151
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:41,187
I keep telling you,
I just grow sorghum here.

152
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:44,406
- And where are the hookers?
- Around back.

153
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,690
But first, she was a university honors
student who devoted her life to kids.

154
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:52,995
Until the night a grossly overweight
pervert named Homer Simpson...

155
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,872
...gave her a crash course
in depravity.

156
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,918
"Babysitter and the Beast."

157
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,708
Oh, crap.

158
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:02,820
Somebody had to take
the babysitter home.

159
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,797
Then I noticed she was sitting
on her sweet can...

160
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,755
I grabbed her sweet can...

161
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,172
Oh, just thinking about her can...

162
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,553
I just wish I had
her sweet, sweet, sweet can.

163
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,806
So, Mr. Simpson,
you admit you grabbed her can.

164
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:17,855
What do you have to say
in your defense?

165
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:22,479
Mr. Simpson, your silence
will only incriminate you further.

166
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:26,696
No, Mr. Simpson, don’t take your anger
out on me. Get back. Get back!

167
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:30,117
- Mr. Simpson, no!
- Dramatization: May not have happened.

168
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,292
Marge, kids,
everything's gonna be just fine.

169
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,666
Now go upstairs and pack your bags.

170
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:43,100
We're gonna start a new life
under the sea.

171
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,434
Under the sea

172
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,275
Under the sea

173
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,642
There'll be no accusations

174
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:09,439
Just friendly crustaceans
Under the sea

175
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,000
That's your solution to everything,
to move under the sea. It won't happen.

176
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,257
Not with that attitude.

177
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,410
Look, maybe this whole thing
will blow over.

178
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,723
It didn't blow over, Marge.
Nothing ever blows over for me.

179
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:53,489
Simpson scandal update.

180
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:57,576
Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent
he believes gives him sexual powers.

181
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,750
Hey, that's a half-truth.

182
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,211
I don’t know Homer Simpson.

183
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,544
I never met Homer Simpson
or had any contact with him, but...

184
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,176
I'm sorry, I can’t go on.

185
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,304
That's okay. Your tears say more
than real evidence ever could.

186
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,388
Today on Ben:

187
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:23,224
Mothers and runaway daughters reunited
by their hatred of Homer Simpson.

188
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,350
And here's your host, Gentle Ben.

189
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:34,577
I just have one thing to say.

190
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:38,950
Let's have less Homer Simpsons
and more money for public schools.

191
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,789
Ben, I have a question.

192
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,581
No, Ben. No.

193
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:59,634
And now we return to
Fox Night at the Movies.

194
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:03,394
Homer S: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber.
Starring Dennis Franz.

195
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,768
Portrait. Sounds classy.

196
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:09,529
Doesn't it?

197
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,730
No, Mr. Simpson.
A cat is a living creature.

198
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,829
I don’t care.

199
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:32,133
Now I'm gonna grab me
something sweet.

200
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,551
No, Mr. Simpson.
That's sexual harassment.

201
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:37,888
If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud,
the whole country will hear.

202
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:41,811
With a man in the White House?

203
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,550
Not likely.

204
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:51,271
This is hour 57 of our live,
round-the-clock coverage...

205
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:52,905
...outside the Simpson estate.

206
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,407
Remember to tune in tonight at 8:00
for highlights of today's vigil...

207
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,486
...including when
the garbage man came...

208
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,821
...and when Marge Simpson
put the cat out.

209
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,667
Possibly because it was harassed.
We don’t know.

210
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,340
There's no way to see
into the Simpson home...

211
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:09,248
...without some kind of infrared,
heat-sensitive camera.

212
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:11,416
So let's turn it on.

213
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,673
Now, this technology is new to me...

214
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:16,596
...but I'm pretty sure
that's Homer Simpson in the oven...

215
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:21,342
...rotating slowly. His body temperature
has risen to over 400 degrees.

216
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:23,725
He's literally stewing
in his own juices.

217
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:26,263
Now here are some results
from our phone-in poll.

218
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,690
Ninety-five percent of the people
believe Homer Simpson is guilty.

219
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,936
Of course,
this is just a television poll...

220
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:35,528
...which is not legally binding,
unless Proposition 304 passes.

221
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,750
And we all pray it will.

222
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,780
I don't have a friend in the world.

223
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,535
- Let us through.
- We're Homer's true friends.

224
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,534
Oh, really?

225
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:50,579
- Come on, let us through, you vultures.
- Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.

226
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:52,292
How can you judge this man...

227
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,171
...without talking to the people
who know him best?

228
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:58,927
We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson,
and the bidding starts at 10 G's.

229
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,841
- I bid 10 G's.
- Ten-five G's.

230
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:05,978
I need a hug.

231
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,859
How come you guys hesitated?

232
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,561
Sorry, Dad.
We do believe in you. We really do.

233
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,399
It's just hard not to listen to TV.

234
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,947
It's spent so much more time
raising us than you.

235
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,738
Maybe TV is right.

236
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:24,953
TV's always right.

237
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:34,876
Are you hugging the TV?

238
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,544
- No.
- No.

239
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:47,976
And the number one reference
that I am running into the ground is:

240
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,311
Homer Simpson.

241
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,149
Is Homer Simpson.

242
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:07,906
I like it better when they're
making fun of people who aren't me.

243
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,875
I know. Evening at the Improv.

244
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,369
They never talk about anything
beyond the 1980s.

245
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,292
I think about weird stuff.

246
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,501
Like, what would happen if E. T.
And Mr. T had a baby?

247
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,752
Well, you'd get Mr. E. T.,
wouldn't you?

248
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:23,380
And, you know, I think he'd sound
a little something like this:

249
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:27,389
"I pity the fool
who doesn't phone home."

250
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,600
I wouldn't wanna be
Mr. T right now.

251
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:34,980
Homer. Homer, the kids have a
great idea how you can clear your name.

252
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:38,290
The media's making you a monster
because they don't care about truth.

253
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:39,988
All they care about is entertainment.

254
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:43,443
You need a forum where they don't
know the meaning of entertainment:

255
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,695
Public access television.

256
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:49,573
- But those shows all look so crummy.
- Well, we could dress it up a bit.

257
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,911
We can bring a fern,
and a folding chair from the garage...

258
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,410
...and the most decorative thing of all,
the truth.

259
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,849
There are only 49 stars on that flag.

260
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,104
I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground
before I recognize Missouri.

261
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,514
Now it's time for
The Innocence Report...

262
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,401
...with Homer Simpson.

263
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,106
Hello. I am Homer Simpson.

264
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:25,983
Or, as some of you wags
have dubbed me, "Father Goose."

265
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:30,238
You know, everybody believed
the worst about me right away.

266
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,492
Nobody cares that I didn't do it.

267
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:33,996
But I didn't.

268
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:37,400
Okay, look, I've done
some bad things in my life.

269
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:40,126
But harassing women
is not one of them.

270
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:44,292
Like one time, we were having this race
with this stupid, old-timey bicycle...

271
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,965
...with the big wheel in front.

272
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,216
So I figure, "We'll see about that."

273
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:51,891
So I get this big chunk
of cinderblock, and I...

274
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,517
Oh, gotta go.

275
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,650
Innocent.

276
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,682
Dad, you did it. I am so proud of you.

277
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,434
The switchboards are lighting up.

278
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,445
Two calls. That's our best ever.

279
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,905
Hello? No, Janice doesn't live here.

280
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,577
Hello? Yes, I am interested
in long-distance savings.

281
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,824
Very interested.

282
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:18,875
Marge, this is so depressing.

283
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,748
My only hope
is this homemade Prozac.

284
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:25,835
Needs more ice cream.

285
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:31,719
So you don't like
the old-time bikes, huh?

286
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:40,194
Homer, I love amateur video.

287
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,730
And your show
is the most amateur video I ever saw.

288
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:47,903
My hobby is secretly
videotaping couples in cars.

289
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,780
I didn't come forward
because in this country...

290
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:53,203
...it makes you look like a pervert.

291
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:56,950
But every single
Scottish person does it!

292
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,624
Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

293
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,632
Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby.

294
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,802
Here we go.

295
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:09,628
Precious Venus.

296
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,426
Thank you.

297
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,147
Dad, this clears you completely.

298
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:21,475
You know, the courts might not
work anymore...

299
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:24,569
...but as long as everybody
is videotaping everyone else...

300
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,778
...justice will be done.

301
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,274
See?

302
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,911
Homer, I thought you were an animal.

303
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,203
But your daughter said
you were a decent man.

304
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:38,790
- I guess she was right.
- You're both right.

305
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:42,289
In our mad pursuit of a scoop...

306
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:46,171
...we members of the press
sometimes make mistakes.

307
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:49,480
Rock Bottom would like to make
the following corrections:

308
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:54,308
Wow, V8 juice
isn't one-eighth gasoline.

309
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:58,688
- And Ted Koppel is a robot.
- There's you, Dad.

310
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,183
Tomorrow on Rock Bottom.

311
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:06,778
He's a foreigner who takes perverted
videos of you when you least suspect it.

312
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:09,236
He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper".

313
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:12,826
Oh, that man is sick.

314
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,904
Groundskeeper Willie
saved you, Homer.

315
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,369
But listen to the music. He's evil.

316
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,992
Hasn't this experience taught you
you can't believe everything you hear?

317
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,583
Marge, my friend,
I haven't learned a thing.

318
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:35,635
Let's never fight again.
