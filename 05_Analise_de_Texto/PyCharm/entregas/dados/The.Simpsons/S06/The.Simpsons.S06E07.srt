1
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,762
BART'S GIRLFRIEND

2
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,927
Remember, Bart...
I mean, Dances in Underwear.

3
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,893
- We take the white man alive.

4
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,395
All right, Thinks Too Much.
It shall be so.

5
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,483
Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns.
I mean, Native Americans.

6
00:00:56,654 --> 00:01:00,105
They're after us because we gave them
blankets infected with cooties.

7
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,363
I ate all my caps.

8
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,404
Throw down your weapons
and kiss the prairie, cow dorks!

9
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:11,583
Why do we have to play
this corny old game anyway?

10
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,620
I brought my jacks!

11
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,414
I got twosies!

12
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:25,177
That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have
the Killmatic 3000 back then.

13
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:29,223
Hey, records from that era
are spotty at best.

14
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:36,812
Bart! Lisa! Time for church!

15
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,819
Milhouse, time for church!

16
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:41,858
Shlomo, time for your violin lesson!

17
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:00,755
Why the crap do we have
to go church anyway?

18
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,844
You just answered your own question
with that commode mouth.

19
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,717
Besides, you kids need to learn
morals and decency...

20
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:08,592
...and how to love your fellow man.

21
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:14,722
And with flaming swords, the Aramites
did pierce the eyes of their fellow men...

22
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:17,899
...and did feast on what flowed forth.

23
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,811
Among whom also we all
once conducted ourselves...

24
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,697
...in the lusts of our flesh...

25
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,989
I'm a troll man

26
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,404
I'm a troll man

27
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,825
I don't want you playing with something
that has such bizarre hair.

28
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,325
Awful, awful hair.

29
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,215
And now my daughter, Jessica...

30
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,673
...who has just returned
from boarding school...

31
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,383
...will read the same passage
I just read.

32
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,427
I noticed a few of you
weren't paying attention.

33
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,109
Wow, there is a God.

34
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:08,777
I'm telling you, the light would
work better if it pointed out to sea!

35
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:11,788
Shut up, I know what I'm doing.

36
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,917
I hate the sea and everything in it.

37
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,169
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Thank you for choosing our church.

38
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,400
I've never felt this way
about a girl before.

39
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,843
My long search is finally over.

40
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:35,894
Hi, I'm Bart Simpson.

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,815
I was incredibly moved by your reading.

42
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:42,316
I don't think God's words
have ever sounded so plausible.

43
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,686
Thanks, Art.

44
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,693
I have to go over here now.

45
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,828
Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart.

46
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,323
It's not your fault Jessica
doesn't like you.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,374
Is it my hair? My overbite?

48
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:01,747
The fact that I've worn the same clothes
for the last four years?

49
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:06,920
No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica
are too different to get along.

50
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,886
She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter,
and you're the devil's cabana boy.

51
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,468
Good. Very good.

52
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:19,935
Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels.

53
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,816
- Bart Simpson?
- Yes, ma'am.

54
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:28,237
I'd like to return to your wonderful
Sunday school, please.

55
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,980
But, Bart, we banned you
from Sunday school.

56
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,784
You were happy. We were happy.
Everybody was happy.

57
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,699
Particularly the hamster.

58
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:41,501
I've changed my ways.

59
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:44,370
Please give me
another chance, ma'am.

60
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:48,254
All right, Bart.
The Bible does teach forgiveness.

61
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:51,713
Class, I want you to welcome back
our prodigal son.

62
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,846
- What?
- What's prodigal mean?

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,344
Oh, dear.

64
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:58,175
You know, the great thing about
Sunday school...

65
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:01,230
...is we're finally learning
something we can use.

66
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,898
Yeah, so true.

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,767
I have to turn my chair this way now.

68
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:10,447
Somehow I gotta convince her
I'm a good person.

69
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:14,827
All right, I have to sit here and behave,
no matter what.

70
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:18,281
Okay, class. We have a special
treat today for pass-around.

71
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:22,407
A replica of the slingshot
David used to slay Goliath.

72
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:26,584
While you kids are looking at that,
I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet.

73
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,346
Must fight Satan.

74
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,848
Make it up to him...

75
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,896
...later.

76
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,729
You know, I was considering
staying after school...

77
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:49,440
...and helping teacher clean up.

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,907
Do you ever think anything
you don't say?

79
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:58,532
There is just no pleasing
a girl like that!

80
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:01,660
All that unnecessary behaving.

81
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,668
I'm all tense through the chestal area.
I need relief.

82
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:16,389
Now, the kilt was only
for day-to-day wear.

83
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:21,551
In battle, we donned a full-length
ball gown covered in sequins.

84
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,104
The idea was to blind
your opponent with luxury.

85
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,977
'Tis no more than what God gave me,
you Puritan pukes.

86
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:39,656
That'll hold me, at least till I get
my hands on some kind of explosives.

87
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:46,620
Congratulations, Simpson.

88
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:51,131
You just fell for our sting and won
yourself three months' detention.

89
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:54,508
There's no such thing
as Scotchtoberfest!

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,512
There's not? You used me, Skinner!
You used me!

91
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,141
Three months?

92
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,515
Hi, Bart.

93
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:10,559
I saw the way they set you up.
That was really unfair.

94
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:14,354
Wanna have dinner
at my house tonight?

95
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:17,319
Really? Sure.

96
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:20,574
Great. We eat at 7.

97
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,280
There's only one thing to do
at a moment like this:

98
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,573
Strut.

99
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:45,266
I can't believe my little boy
is already going on his first date.

100
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,115
Oh, that's sweet, Homer.
Our son is growing up, isn't he?

101
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,536
No, it's not that. Didn't you hear?

102
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:09,914
They have no bananas.
They have no bananas today.

103
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:18,386
So, Bart, how's school going?
Jessica always gets straight A's.

104
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:21,217
Well, in my family,
grades aren't that important.

105
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,548
It's what you learn that counts.

106
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,552
Six times five! What is it?

107
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,813
Actually, numbers don't have
much use in my future career:

108
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,104
Olympic gold-medal rocket-sled champ!

109
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,974
I didn't know the rocket sled
was an Olympic event.

110
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:37,610
Well, no offense, but what you
don't know could fill a warehouse.

111
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,614
Young man, explain yourself!

112
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:43,698
Sorry. I have kind of a short fuse,
which some find charming.

113
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,748
Speaking of charming,
watching Fox last night...

114
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:49,371
...I heard a rather amusing story.

115
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:52,829
This character named Martin
was feeling rather randy...

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,547
...and he was heard to remark...

117
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,427
And don't you ever come near
my daughter again!

118
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:01,755
Never have I heard such
gratuitous use of the word "butt"!

119
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,764
- But... But... But...
- Make him stop!

120
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:06,910
- But... But... But...
- Make him stop!

121
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,436
You're bad, Bart Simpson.

122
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,315
No, I'm not. I'm really...

123
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,109
Yes, you are. You're bad.
And I like it.

124
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:21,901
I'm bad to the bone, honey.

125
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,911
- Let's go find some fun.
- But your father said...

126
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,655
I told the rev I was going
to my room to say my prayers.

127
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,283
Smart, beautiful and a liar.

128
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:36,498
So much better than that
Sarah, plain and tall.

129
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,976
Right there! Put that there!

130
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,643
Excellent! You're incredible, Jessica.

131
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:03,818
Your throws, your catches,
your spirals, your loops.

132
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,403
It's like the toilet paper
is an extension of your body.

133
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:12,407
No way would a minister's daughter
go out with you.

134
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:14,204
Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.

135
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,454
- Hey, Jessica.
- Yes?

136
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,585
- Am I supposed to know you?
- Jessica, we just...

137
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,709
That's for besmirching
an innocent girl's name.

138
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:29,349
- Why?
- I'm sorry, Bart.

139
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,430
You know my parents
can't find out about us.

140
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:37,350
And besides, if it's secret,
it's even more exciting.

141
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:40,226
- I guess.
- Hey, you wanna go skateboarding?

142
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,487
Actually, I was hoping I could
sit down for just a second.

143
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,487
Come on, it'll be fun.

144
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,822
Now I have the energy to do anything.

145
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,704
Just give me two minutes.

146
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,833
Jessica, I think this is too steep.

147
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,960
Bart, you can't trust your perception
at this altitude.

148
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:16,224
Actually, if the road surface
maintains its integrity...

149
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,307
...I just might be able to hold on.

150
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,452
The glue will slow me down.

151
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,168
- Any glue leaking?
- No. That glue ain't going nowhere.

152
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:42,249
Nothing's ever gonna stop me.

153
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:54,301
Oh, no. There goes the glue after all.

154
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,896
Fun, huh?

155
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,571
Have you noticed any change in Bart?

156
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,284
- New glasses?
- No.

157
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,830
He looks like something
might be disturbing him.

158
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,918
Probably misses his old glasses.

159
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,834
I guess we could get more involved
in Bart's activities.

160
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,333
But then I'd be afraid
of smothering him.

161
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,713
- Yeah. And then we'd get the chair.
- That's not what I meant.

162
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,424
It was, Marge. Admit it.

163
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:37,636
- Hi.
- We should get to class.

164
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,856
- What's the hurry?
- We could get in trouble for being late.

165
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,649
You worry too much.

166
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,154
Come on. If you stay here a while,
I'll let you hold my hand.

167
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,328
Teamwork! Come on, Bart.

168
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:03,628
If I don't save the wee turtles,
who will?

169
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:11,880
Save me from the wee turtles!
They were too quick for me!

170
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,722
I can't believe it, Bart.

171
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,800
I'd always thought Jessica
was so sweet.

172
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:17,727
She's like a Milk Dud, Lis:

173
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:21,103
Sweet on the outside,
poison on the inside.

174
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:24,185
- You gotta give her up.
- No, no, wait. Hear my plan.

175
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,727
Put up with her for seven more years.

176
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,232
Then we'll get married.

177
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,905
Once the first baby comes, she's bound
to settle down and treat me right.

178
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,446
After all, I deserve it.

179
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:36,827
Bart, it's naive to think
you can change a person.

180
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:40,413
Except maybe that boy
who works in the library.

181
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:43,951
Do you have Go, Dog, Go?

182
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,830
That's in Juvenile.
This is Young Adult.

183
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,134
Well-read and just a little wild.

184
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:53,680
If only someone could tame him.

185
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,472
You're right, Lisa.
Love isn't about fixing someone.

186
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:59,932
I'm just gonna give her up cold turkey.

187
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:03,990
I'm not gonna talk to her or see her.
It's over.

188
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:05,438
Thanks for the advice, sis.

189
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,613
There. If I can just get through
this many days without seeing her...

190
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,790
...she should be completely
out of my system.

191
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,371
Okay, day one.

192
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,460
Time for church, Bart.

193
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:33,469
I bet your little friend Jessica
will be there.

194
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,719
- Jessica.
- Bart, be strong.

195
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,639
You don't need that little hellcat.

196
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:48,183
Oh, Lis, she's already
drawn me to her...

197
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,650
...with her beautiful siren song.

198
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:02,196
That's very disturbing.

199
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,786
Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong?

200
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:11,860
Well, Jessica, I don't think we should
hang out together anymore.

201
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:15,635
You're turning me into a criminal
when all I want to be is a petty thug.

202
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:19,302
Oh, good.
Here comes the collection plate.

203
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,641
"Thirty cents off Shake ’N' Bake."

204
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:31,267
- Homer!
- We can spare it, Marge.

205
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,856
We've been blessed.

206
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,819
You're right about everything, Bart.

207
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:38,670
I have been too reckless.

208
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:42,330
From now on,
I am going to settle down.

209
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,794
Jessica, what are you doing?

210
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,577
Well, it takes money
to start a new life.

211
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:54,582
Stealing from the collection basket
is really wrong. Even I know that.

212
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,803
Fine. You just lost your cut.

213
00:15:58,514 --> 00:15:59,924
I'll just take that.

214
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,591
Everyone turn around and look at this.

215
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,598
What is it? A Unitarian?

216
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,290
Now just relax. For once,
you didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:16,817
Just explain yourself
and everyone will understand.

218
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,776
- L...
- Took the money? Yes, we know.

219
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,109
- He confessed!
- Okay.

220
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:26,411
Stop him!
He's headed for the window!

221
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:34,337
Son, if you look me in the eye and say
you didn't take the collection money...

222
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,507
...that's all I need.

223
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,718
- I didn't take it.
- Why, you little...

224
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,547
How can you lie like that?

225
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:43,260
Homer, stop that! I believe him.

226
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:47,805
Tell me, if he didn't take the money,
why is he wearing those fancy clothes?

227
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,807
That's what he wore to church.

228
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:51,559
How convenient.

229
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:54,562
Bart, honey, do you know
who did take the money?

230
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,946
- No.
- See, son?

231
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:01,150
Telling the truth isn't so bad.

232
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:06,789
- Boo!
- Boo!

233
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,659
- Why, you little...!
- Crook!

234
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,992
- Thief!
- Stealer of money from the church!

235
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:16,544
We've gotta talk.

236
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,210
Listen, thanks for not turning me in.
That was sweet.

237
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,262
Well, it seems like if you really
care for me, you should come forward.

238
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,849
Don't you see? It's because I care
for you that I can't come forward.

239
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,473
That doesn't make any sense.

240
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,598
Then I just don't feel like it, okay?

241
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:36,814
Jessica, you're really beautiful,
but you are not very nice.

242
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:40,354
With the way you treat me,
why should I protect you?

243
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:43,699
Because if you tell,
no one will believe you.

244
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:47,487
Remember, I'm the sweet,
perfect minister's daughter.

245
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,248
And you're just yellow trash.

246
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,630
So here's where you're hiding.

247
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,755
This is my only refuge from the taunts
and accusations of the townspeople.

248
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:02,588
Thief.

249
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,801
Bart, we can't just let her
get away with this!

250
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,851
Give it up, Lis.
She's a criminal mastermind.

251
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:13,147
She's got a 108 IQ,
she reads at a fifth-grade level.

252
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:17,140
And her hair smells
like red Froot Loops.

253
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,566
Yeah? Well, I eat Froot Loops
for breakfast.

254
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,734
Because of last week's problems...

255
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:27,159
...we'll be taking certain precautions
with this week's collection.

256
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:30,954
We shouldn't have let them do this.
It can't be helping his self-esteem.

257
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,333
Now for our offertory reading,
Lisa Simpson...

258
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,833
...who we'll all be keeping an eye on.

259
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:42,711
I know most of you have already judged
my brother guilty without any proof.

260
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:48,302
But doesn't the Bible teach us
"judge not, lest ye be judged," Reverend?

261
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,883
I think it may be somewhere
towards the back.

262
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:53,641
There is someone among us
with a guilty conscience.

263
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:58,610
After much soul-searching, I decided
it would be wrong of me to name names.

264
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:02,738
But I urge that guilty person here,
under the eyes of God...

265
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,982
...to come forward, to confess...

266
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,737
...and save yourself from the torment
of your own personal hell!

267
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:12,613
I smelled some marijuana smoke
in Vietnam!

268
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,750
I was the one that canceled Star Trek!

269
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,455
I left my Porsche keys
inside Mrs. Glick.

270
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:21,377
I am talking to
the collection-money thief!

271
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:26,170
Only you can come forward
and end this injustice!

272
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:32,516
Oh, what the heck.
It was Jessica Lovejoy!

273
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:37,763
If you search her room,
I am certain you will find the money.

274
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:40,308
- To the little girl's room!
- Yeah!

275
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:44,527
That's the collection money!

276
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:46,442
Oh, yeah. Smells like church.

277
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:48,734
I guess it's obvious
what's happened here.

278
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:53,390
Bart Simpson has somehow managed
to sneak his bedroom into my house.

279
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,118
Well, come on! Use your imaginations!

280
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:01,706
No, Dad. I did it.

281
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:06,480
It's your classic cry for attention.

282
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,889
Well, young lady, I suppose
we brought you home...

283
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,464
...from boarding school
a little prematurely.

284
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:13,972
I was expelled, Dad.

285
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,220
Remember the pipe bomb?
The glee club brawl?

286
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,685
Remember the school chapel
collection plate?

287
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:23,354
The exploding toilets ring a bell?
Come on, Dad, pay attention to me!

288
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,981
Hello, in there. Hello?

289
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:29,191
I think you all owe my son an apology.

290
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:32,121
- Very sorry.
- That's okay. Appreciate it.

291
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,659
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Bart.

292
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:41,586
Come to watch me suffer?

293
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:45,711
I just wanted to let you know that even
though this was a difficult experience...

294
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:47,628
...I really learned a lot.

295
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:51,427
I'm a little wiser
and a little less naive.

296
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,883
Well, I learned that I can make men
do whatever I want.

297
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,274
Well, don't you see, Jessica?
Then you really haven't learned...

298
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,476
Would you finish scrubbing these steps?

299
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,687
Will I?

300
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:08,739
Hey, Jessica!

301
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:10,609
Coming!

302
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:18,621
Poor sucker. It's amazing what
some guys will do for a pretty face.

303
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,251
Not me though.

304
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:24,458
Wait till she sees the second-rate job
I do on these stairs.
