1
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,834
Surprised he doesn't
make us do that.

2
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,797
The pack totally has a pecking order.

3
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,718
And the head hyena,
he's the man, you know.

4
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,429
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

5
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,723
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

6
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,101
They have to lick his junk.

7
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,772
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

8
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:34,821
Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
like, major-league and all...

9
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,826
...we should have... equipment
maintainer guys.

10
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,374
And water boys, you know?

11
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,253
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

12
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,090
Get us a couple flunkies in here.

13
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,217
Treat us right.

14
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,690
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

15
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,192
I'm gonna hit it,
if that's cool with you.

16
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,070
- I don't understand.
- What?

17
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,364
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

18
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,783
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

19
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,661
No, it's not that.

20
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:27,666
It's our output. We're off.
We're.14 percent off.

21
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,087
Point one-four. That's, what, like...?

22
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,714
What does that mean?

23
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,593
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

24
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,389
So how far off are we?

25
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,975
It's not negligible.

26
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:51,607
Ball-parking at it, I'd say
we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.

27
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,569
That's weird.

28
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,654
Well, what about spillage?

29
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,907
Spillage?

30
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,242
You know, when,
like, just stuff gets spilled.

31
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,369
Nothing gets spilled.

32
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,787
A little maybe.

33
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,581
Nothing gets spilled.

34
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,042
What about evaporation?

35
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,546
It wouldn't account for this much.
The materials aren't out that long.

36
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,507
What about the other one?

37
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,510
The drops, like on...

38
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,637
Like on, like, cold beer.

39
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,264
- Condensation?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,016
No.

41
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,270
Well, what about the crap
that gets left behind?

42
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,357
You know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats.

43
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,902
Gotta add up to like a gallon each.

44
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,279
Did you work that in?

45
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,368
- Vestiges.
- Yeah. Vestiges.

46
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,122
Bet that's it.

47
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,667
Bet that's totally it.

48
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,756
Hey, Mr. White.

49
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,342
Mr. White.

50
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,846
Are you okay?

51
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,682
Yeah. Yeah, why?

52
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,936
Nothing.

53
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,323
Are you coming?

54
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,159
Yeah, in a minute.

55
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,788
All right, see you tomorrow.

56
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,185
All right.

57
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,817
Shit.

58
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,571
Bastard.

59
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,417
Son of a...

60
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,016
Come on, you...

61
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,018
Come on, come on.

62
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,608
Son of a...

63
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,714
Come on.

64
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,721
Son of a bitch.

65
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,614
That's great.

66
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,560
All right.

67
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,125
You little bastard.

68
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,521
Shut the door!

69
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,691
- My ears are popping.
- Shut the door. Move.

70
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,611
Feels like on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

71
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,988
Positive pressure.

72
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,865
Positive what?

73
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,367
God, it frigging kills, yo.

74
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,245
- Well, just move your jaw around.
- I am moving it around.

75
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,539
- It's not working.
- Just yawn or something.

76
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,457
Stop acting like such a baby.

77
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,709
Damn.

78
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,254
What positive? Positive what?

79
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:15,717
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up
to keep the outside out.

80
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,137
There's been a contamination.

81
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,640
Wait. What?

82
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.

83
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,853
Something got into the lab.

84
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,564
So, what do we do?

85
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,898
I mean, do we...?

86
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,693
Wait. Wait. I mean,
shouldn't we be wearing masks?

87
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,613
No, no, it's not that kind
of contaminant.

88
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,491
So it's, like, not dangerous?

89
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,578
Mr. White, talk to me here.

90
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,999
Not to us particularly, no.

91
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,710
What the hell is that?

92
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,462
This is...

93
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,381
I made it.

94
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,053
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

95
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,060
A fly.

96
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,480
What do you mean?

97
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,275
A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?

98
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,237
I mean, a fly. A housefly.

99
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,825
Like one fly?

100
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,619
Singular?

101
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,580
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab.

102
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,916
I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

103
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:35,464
No, man, not really. I can't say that
I'm really following you here.

104
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,134
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!

105
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,303
When you say it's contamination,
I mean...

106
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,764
...I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
or something.

107
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,015
Ebola.

108
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,768
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel...

109
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,021
...where all your intestines sort of
just slip out of your butt.

110
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,732
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Now, tell me.

111
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:58,737
What would a West African virus
be doing in our lab?

112
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:06,411
So you're chasing around a fly
and in your world, I'm the idiot.

113
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,831
Jesse, listen.

114
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,211
This fly...
No, any fly cannot be in our lab.

115
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,505
It's a problem. It's a contamination.

116
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,092
And that is in no way a misuse
of the word. Okay?

117
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:26,265
So in terms of keeping our cook clean
and our product unadulterated...

118
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,809
...we need to take this very seriously.

119
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,686
Now do you understand?

120
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,983
So is that your fly-sabre?

121
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,862
This is a swatter.

122
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,739
And it happens to work quite well,
thank you.

123
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:46,243
Hey, what happened to your head?

124
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,911
Nothing. I'm fine.

125
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,123
You didn't hit it,
like really, really hard?

126
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,586
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.

127
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:03,385
You didn't happen to maybe try
our product, did you?

128
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,222
Jesse, I know this seems unusual
to you, a layman.

129
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,976
A fly. I get it.
It seems insignificant, right?

130
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:15,397
But trust me, in a highly controlled
environment such as this...

131
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,319
...any pollutant...

132
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,323
...no matter how small...

133
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,204
...could completely...

134
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,219
Hello?

135
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,097
What?

136
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,312
Were you here all night?

137
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,231
Have you even slept?

138
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,942
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?

139
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,402
Will you just please focus on...?

140
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,452
Okay, look, we're running late,
so let's just get started.

141
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,746
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

142
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,666
Fricking finally.

143
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,130
What are you doing?

144
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,383
It's time to alkaline.

145
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,719
Have you not heard a word I said?

146
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,139
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

147
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,600
Have I been speaking to myself?

148
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,061
The timer went off, yo.

149
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,356
How long is this batch gonna be
good for? An hour? Two?

150
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:43,360
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don't clear the contaminant.

151
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,571
"Clear the contaminant."

152
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,323
We're making meth here, all right?
Not space shuttles.

153
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,160
We're making nothing until
we catch this fly.

154
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,495
What fly? All right?

155
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:57,374
Where the hell is this fly?
Not like I even seen the thing.

156
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,919
Maybe your positive pressure blew it
out the door or something.

157
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,839
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?

158
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,801
He's around, and I am not going
to expose this batch...

159
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,220
...to the open air and contamination,
period.

160
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,891
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself or you can help me.

161
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,226
But you are right.
We're running out of time.

162
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:19,021
So I need your answer right now.

163
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,404
Okay.

164
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:41,418
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

165
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,720
Look, I like making cherry product,
but let's keep it real, all right?

166
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,058
We make poison for people
who don't care.

167
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,019
We probably have the most un-picky
customers in the world.

168
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,813
No, no, no. No rationalizing.

169
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,067
We'll find it any minute.
Don't give up.

170
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:22,751
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds...

171
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,088
...that can go into candy bars?

172
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,591
That's the government, Jack.

173
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:36,390
Even the government doesn't care
that much about quality.

174
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:43,605
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs, huh?

175
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,650
Pig lips and assholes.

176
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:53,156
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
because I love hotdogs.

177
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:57,327
- And, you know, see what I'm try...?
- What are you doing?

178
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,330
Oh, hey.

179
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,710
Look, let me just top it off,
all right, really quick.

180
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,462
You know, a little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

181
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,215
No harm done. Then we're golden.

182
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,514
It stays closed. That's an order.

183
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:24,021
You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
We're 50-50 partners, remember?

184
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,404
God, what is your problem?

185
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,202
Freaking psycho.

186
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,746
- Jesse.
- Oh, God.

187
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,749
- It, like, hit bone.
- Jesse.

188
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,542
Jesse.

189
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,964
You see it, right?

190
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,509
You see it?

191
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,302
Yeah.

192
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,473
Get it.

193
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,101
You want me to get it?

194
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,020
Yes.

195
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,736
Slow. Move slowly.

196
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,989
I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.

197
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,535
Absolutely. I'm just gonna need
your swatter thing.

198
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,290
Come on.

199
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,460
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.

200
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,295
Yeah.

201
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,881
- Yeah, come on.
- Just make it count.

202
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,969
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make it count, all right.

203
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,973
Okay. Now, on three.

204
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,558
Okay.

205
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,892
One...

206
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,436
Motherfuck...!

207
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:51,024
Yeah. You like that, huh?
Hurts, huh?

208
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,822
- Did you get it?
- I think so, yeah.

209
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,491
- Where is it?
- I don't know. What does it matter?

210
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,535
Who cares? I got it.

211
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,080
- Oh, Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

212
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,168
It's right there. Look.

213
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,463
Look. See? I told you I got it.

214
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,600
This is a raisin.

215
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,854
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...

216
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,733
Oh, man.

217
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,028
He's got some skills, yo.

218
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,738
I'll give him that.

219
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,907
Look.

220
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:46,038
I feel like I'm running out of ways
to explain this to you...

221
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,499
...but once more, I shall try.

222
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,629
This fly is a major problem for us.

223
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,548
It will ruin our batch.

224
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:01,386
And we need to destroy it
and every trace of it so we can cook.

225
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,681
Failing that...

226
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,019
...we're dead.

227
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,275
There is no more room for error.

228
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,321
Not with these people.

229
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,576
All right, how about we go
get some air?

230
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,621
"Get some air"?

231
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,207
Your answer to,
"We're sliding headfirst...

232
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,876
...into a massive crap..."
- Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.

233
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,296
All right, I understand that the fly
is a serious thing now.

234
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,673
All right? I'm on board.

235
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:41,009
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe if we went and got some air...

236
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,930
...it would help us come up with a plan
on how to catch it.

237
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,809
Then come back down here
and subtract his ass.

238
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,207
- Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
- Yeah.

239
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,252
You sure? Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

240
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,380
Yeah. Hey!

241
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,258
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way!

242
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,926
Hey!

243
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:32,144
Yo, yo, does somebody have
an axe I can use?

244
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,555
There we go.

245
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,229
Say good night.

246
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,816
Son of a bitch!

247
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,531
Son of a...

248
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,701
Damn it.

249
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,206
Where in the hell is that...?

250
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,350
What the hell?

251
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:01,149
Need some juice maybe?

252
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,863
Knock yourself out.

253
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,281
It's a real one.

254
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,408
Yeah, like yours was working.

255
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,744
No, no, no.

256
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,913
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

257
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,791
You don't decontaminate by
contaminating further.

258
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,043
What the hell is all this?

259
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,214
Here, how about this?

260
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,717
"Non-toxic glue strips."

261
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,179
Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones,
all right? I got a butt-Ioad.

262
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,807
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

263
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,732
I sure hope we have... enough.

264
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:46,195
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say yeah.

265
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,614
Do you see him?

266
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,160
How long do you think
you've been awake?

267
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,120
Why do you keep asking me that?

268
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,875
Just figure, you know, you could use
some coffee, is all. I know I could.

269
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,919
How about it?

270
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,339
Yeah.

271
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,761
- You take cream and sugar?
- Black is fine.

272
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,151
Why don't you just leave him be?

273
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,570
Let the traps do the work.

274
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:32,950
These pheromones are supposed
to kick ass.

275
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:37,996
Bet we catch this mofo any second.

276
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,594
Thank you.

277
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:59,685
You ever have, like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?

278
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,316
Not that I can recall, no.

279
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:11,697
We did, this one time,
back when it was my aunt's house...

280
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,950
...back before she died of cancer.

281
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:20,289
It was a possum.
Big freaky-Iooking bitch.

282
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,458
Hey, since when did they change it
to "opossum"?

283
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:27,713
What's up with that? I mean, when
I was coming up, it was just "possum."

284
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,383
You know, "opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

285
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,095
I mean, why they gotta go
changing everything?

286
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,681
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.

287
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,810
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

288
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:46,857
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

289
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,945
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped...

290
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:56,283
...but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

291
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,620
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room...

292
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,831
...always scurrying around.

293
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,253
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
and it would just, you know, freeze.

294
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,798
I mean, it's like you're not looking
right at it, right?

295
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,843
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

296
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:18,514
That's what they do.
I mean, they play dead or whatever.

297
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,391
It's just so lame.

298
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,854
Is there a discernible point
to this story?

299
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:31,985
A point that you'll be arriving at
sometime in the near future?

300
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,365
It was just a total bitch to get out.
You know, it took forever.

301
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:43,163
Guy came, set all these traps and all
and he finally got it.

302
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:48,001
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

303
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:53,340
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

304
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,343
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

305
00:27:56,552 --> 00:28:00,681
She started keeping an old umbrella,
you know, by her chair.

306
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,934
Man, she would just bang on the floor
and yell at it.

307
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,478
Even gave it a name.

308
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:10,399
It was Scrabble.

309
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,859
Yeah, that was it.

310
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,821
You know,
"Scrabble, just knock it off:"

311
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:22,327
She got like that toward the... end.

312
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:29,877
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

313
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:32,546
We didn't know what was up.

314
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:37,467
It wasn't like her to be that way.

315
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:46,059
But it turned out that the cancer
had spread to her brain...

316
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,562
...and that was why.

317
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:53,317
It metastasised.

318
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:01,116
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor...

319
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,619
...because then we knew
what was up.

320
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,663
You know, got her some treatment.

321
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:10,667
Meds, so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

322
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:18,175
It was a lot better after that.

323
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,095
You know, she was a lot happier.

324
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,897
Where the hell is he?

325
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,909
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...

326
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,911
...just last week.

327
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,624
I'm still in remission.

328
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,418
I'm healthy.

329
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:58,465
Okay, so good. Great.

330
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,593
Well...

331
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,972
...no end in sight.

332
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,267
That's great.

333
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,187
Well...

334
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,815
...I missed it.

335
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:27,244
There was some perfect moment
and it passed me right by.

336
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,792
I had to have... enough to leave them.

337
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,253
That was the whole point.

338
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:39,798
I mean, none of this...

339
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:44,720
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have... enough.

340
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:50,475
But it had to be
before she found out. Skyler.

341
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,145
It had to be before that.

342
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:57,941
Perfect moment for what?

343
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,320
To drop dead?

344
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,740
What, you saying you wanna die?

345
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:11,955
I'm saying I've lived too long.

346
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,125
I mean...

347
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:19,630
...you want them to actually miss you,
you know?

348
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:25,093
You want their memories of you
to be...

349
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,848
But she just won't...

350
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:33,018
She just won't understand.

351
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:37,898
I mean, no matter how well
I explain it...

352
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:41,109
...these days, she just has this...

353
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,861
This...

354
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:50,160
I mean, I truly believe there... exists
some combination of words.

355
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:55,999
There must exist certain words
in a certain specific order...

356
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:01,547
...that would explain all of this,
but with her, I just...

357
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,591
I just can't ever seem to find them.

358
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,969
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

359
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:10,013
You know, I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state...

360
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:13,517
...but before the fugue state,
I didn't have... enough money.

361
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,187
So no, not then.

362
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:29,366
And plus,
my daughter wasn't born yet.

363
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,828
It had to be after Holly was born.

364
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,663
Mr. White...

365
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,624
Definitely before the surgery.

366
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,545
Oh, Christ.

367
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,047
That damn second cell phone.

368
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,800
I mean, how could I possibly...?

369
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,730
I know the moment.

370
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,695
It was the night Jane died.

371
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:14,119
Yeah, I...

372
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:20,334
I was at home
and we needed diapers...

373
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:25,255
...and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

374
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:29,885
Actually, that was the night
I brought you your money, remember?

375
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,138
Yeah, I remember.

376
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,351
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.

377
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:42,773
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

378
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:46,652
I just walked in, sat down.

379
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:53,200
I never told you.

380
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,119
That you went to a bar?

381
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,664
No, I...

382
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:05,796
I sit down and this man,
this stranger...

383
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,257
...he... engages me in conversation.

384
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,425
He's a complete stranger.

385
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:19,142
But he turns out to be Jane's father,
Donald Margolis.

386
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,144
What are you talking about?

387
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:24,022
Of course, I didn't know it
at the time.

388
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,109
I mean, he was just some guy
in a bar.

389
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:31,488
I didn't put it together until after the
crash when he was all over the news.

390
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,657
Jane's dad.

391
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,660
I mean, think of the odds.

392
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:41,498
Once I tried to calculate them,
but they're astronomical.

393
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:46,420
I mean, think of the odds of me
going in, sitting down...

394
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:50,757
...that night in that bar
next to that man.

395
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:55,429
What did you talk about?

396
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,644
Water on Mars.

397
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,733
Family.

398
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:12,821
What about family?

399
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:20,829
I told him that I had a daughter
and he told me he had one too.

400
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,207
Then he said:

401
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,792
"Never give up on family."

402
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,589
And I didn't.

403
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,677
I took his advice.

404
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:53,028
The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.

405
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:56,281
It's simple chaos.

406
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,203
It's subatomic particles
in endless aimless collision.

407
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,164
That's what science teaches us.

408
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,125
But what is this saying?

409
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:15,843
What is it telling us when, on the very
night that this man's daughter dies...

410
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,889
...it's me who's having a drink
with him?

411
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,311
I mean, how can that be random?

412
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,314
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.

413
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:32,734
No, no. No, it's...

414
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:38,740
No. No.

415
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:47,332
No, that was the moment.

416
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,669
That night.

417
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,466
I should never have left home.

418
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,722
Never gone to your house.

419
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:09,563
Maybe things would have...

420
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,696
Oh, thought I was...

421
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:23,619
I was at home watching TV.

422
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,371
It was some...

423
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:31,960
Some nature programme
about elephants.

424
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:37,382
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

425
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,180
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

426
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,186
She was singing a lullaby.

427
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:02,366
If I had just lived right up
to that moment...

428
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,702
...and not one second more...

429
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,926
...that would have been perfect.

430
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,526
He's not coming down.

431
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,946
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

432
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:43,282
That's why he likes it.

433
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,035
Thailand's hot, right?

434
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:49,746
Yeah.

435
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,624
Then that's why.

436
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,005
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hey, hey, wait. Here.

437
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,813
He's not coming down.

438
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,151
He's staying up there forever.

439
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,595
What are you...? What are you doing?

440
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:50,432
What do you think?
I'm gonna get that bitch.

441
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,356
No, you're gonna break your neck.

442
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,900
Yeah, yeah. Just...

443
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:05,322
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

444
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,408
Damn it.

445
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,160
Jesse.

446
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,495
Just hold onto it.

447
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,914
Hold it still?

448
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,471
Jesse.

449
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,561
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,606
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?

451
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,529
I'm sorry about Jane.

452
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,579
Yeah.

453
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,373
Me too.

454
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,127
I mean...

455
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:07,217
...I'm very sorry.

456
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:14,266
It's not your fault.

457
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,103
It's not mine... either.

458
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:22,524
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

459
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:37,664
You know, we are who we are,
Mr. White.

460
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:43,337
You know, two junkies
with a duffel bag full of cash.

461
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:48,342
Like you said, we both would've
been dead within a week.

462
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,136
But I miss her, though.

463
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,309
God, I do.

464
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:06,485
Jesse.

465
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:08,904
Come down.

466
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:12,449
Wait. I'm so close.

467
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:17,079
Let it go.

468
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,498
We need to cook.

469
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,376
What about the contamination?

470
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,547
It's all contaminated.

471
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,179
All right, well...

472
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,099
...I definitely scared him.

473
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:40,936
Probably stay out of our way.

474
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:13,927
Yeah!

475
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,597
Somebody got got, yo!

476
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,932
Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?

477
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,106
Bins are packed?

478
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,734
Bins are packed.

479
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,903
How's the yield?

480
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:15,489
Two-oh-two and change.

481
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,116
You okay getting home?

482
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,745
Yeah. Better. Thanks.

483
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:23,830
Mañana, then.

484
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,431
Jesse, come here.

485
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,687
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

486
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,607
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

487
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,738
That half a pound
I said we were off by.

488
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:00,492
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

489
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:05,539
You understand?
And if they ever found out...

490
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,836
I didn't take shit.

491
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:19,386
I'm just saying that
I won't be able to protect you.

492
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:23,015
Who's asking you to?
