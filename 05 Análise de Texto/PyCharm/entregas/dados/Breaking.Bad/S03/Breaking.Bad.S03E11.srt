1
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:15,265
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,439
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:29,279
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,784
Seriously? Not even close.

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,872
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,584
Everyday items, her surroundings.

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:48,215
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

8
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,218
It's who she was.

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,472
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

10
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,599
This chick have medical issues?

11
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,019
This particular painting...

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,105
...is of a door.

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,985
Any other doors we can check out?

14
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,988
Like, real ones or...?

15
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,534
You know, I don't get it.

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,662
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door...

17
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,165
...over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

18
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,919
- But it wasn't the same.
- Yeah, it was.

19
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,797
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

20
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,550
The light was different,
her mood was different.

21
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,303
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,472
And that's not psycho to you?

23
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,767
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

24
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,478
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

25
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,232
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

26
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,153
- Whoa, no.
- Should we just watch one sunset?

27
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,448
Or live just one day?

28
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,243
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

29
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,829
Okay, fine.

30
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:06,710
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,757
I will say it again. A door.

32
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,303
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something...

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,764
...and you might not even get why.

34
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,475
You open yourself up
and go with the flow...

35
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,269
...wherever the universe takes you.

36
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:29,149
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door.

37
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:34,238
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times...

38
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,156
...until it was perfect.

39
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,575
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

40
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,995
Yeah? Well...

41
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,540
...I mean...

42
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,167
...some things.

43
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,102
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

44
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,147
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

45
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,694
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over...

46
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,114
...until that stupid door was perfect.

47
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,326
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

48
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,455
To me,
that's about making that feeling last.

49
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,784
All right, here we go. You ready?

50
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,957
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

51
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,466
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

52
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,092
You can do this, Hank.

53
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,722
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

54
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,891
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

55
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,186
- Lf you can get your leg up, go for it.
- Take me up.

56
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,731
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

57
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,777
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

58
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,324
- We'll just pick up where we left off.
- Come on, Hank.

59
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,619
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

60
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,289
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

61
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,502
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

62
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,255
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

63
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,382
It's all right.

64
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,222
I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

65
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,309
Gonna get me out of here
sometime today?

66
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,146
Sky?

67
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,737
We got our first bill,
and, you know, if you're still insistent...

68
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,698
I am.

69
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,206
Prepare yourself.

70
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,883
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so...

71
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,095
You're sure you can do this?

72
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,057
Yeah.

73
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,304
I'll do that.

74
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,643
What the hell, man?

75
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,896
What, I can't work a scale now?

76
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,108
This is bullshit. Just say it.

77
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,693
Just say the words.

78
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,154
You think I'm stealing.

79
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,547
Walk with who you are.

80
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,758
That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me...

81
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,636
...back when I first started
coming to meetings.

82
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,682
It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

83
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,521
But this idea of "walk" also tells me...

84
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,817
...that I have to move forward.
Always good advice, at least for me.

85
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:26,738
I see we have some new people here
at Group, a couple new faces.

86
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,784
See some hands? First time?

87
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,210
Great. Welcome.

88
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,880
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

89
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,174
Say whatever's on your mind.

90
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,093
How about you?
You wanna start us off?

91
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,474
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

92
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,940
We don't bite. No judgements.

93
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,360
You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

94
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,699
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

95
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,581
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

96
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,088
Hey, what's up?

97
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,424
My name's Jesse.

98
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

99
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,973
And this is, I believe, Peter?

100
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,018
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

101
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,446
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

102
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,074
It's gonna get slower
smuggling product...

103
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,826
...with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

104
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,955
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

105
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,499
- Great, right on.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,877
So how's it selling?

107
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,546
Mad volume?

108
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,340
Yeah, it's...

109
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,968
You know, it's...

110
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,554
It's not so good.

111
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,307
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

112
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,768
I sold a teenth.

113
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:24,231
- One teenth? That's it?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,524
To who?

115
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,943
To him.

116
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,866
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

117
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,536
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,164
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

119
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,126
and you're too pussy to sell?

120
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,087
You're pathetic.

121
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,674
You know what? I want it back.
All of it.

122
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,219
- I'll sell it myself.
- Come on, man. Don't be like that.

123
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,015
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

124
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,434
It's not so easy like you think.

125
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:05,564
I will show you
exactly how easy it is.

126
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,028
- Thank you.
- All right.

127
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,113
See you next week.

128
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,752
- Oh, hey, sorry.
- No, go ahead.

129
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,379
Andrea, right?

130
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,091
- Yeah.
- Hey, my name's Jesse...

131
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,222
...and I don't really
wanna be here... either.

132
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,102
Sorry.

133
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,002
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

134
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,921
No.

135
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,465
Your dad is.

136
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,973
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

137
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,225
Are you that boring?

138
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,061
I'm comforting.

139
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,815
I'm a comforting presence.

140
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,827
Hey, so check it out.

141
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,204
See what that means?

142
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,414
Check out the date.

143
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:51,128
Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

144
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,384
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

145
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,054
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

146
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,682
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

147
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,810
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

148
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,896
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

149
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,316
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

150
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,695
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

151
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:21,575
I think I'd be good
with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.

152
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,120
A 'Stang.

153
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,582
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

154
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,877
Makes a nice motory sound,
you know?

155
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,090
Dad, you're not gonna
get off that easy.

156
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,261
Well, I think that this is...

157
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,932
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

158
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,727
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

159
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,646
Okay.

160
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,192
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...

161
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,947
...in Grabber Lime
with a shaker hood.

162
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,490
'Stang.

163
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:07,037
I'll write that down so we don't forget.
Oh, darn it, no pencil.

164
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:35,232
What is
"Ice Station Zebra Associates"?

165
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:40,195
It's a loan out, it's fine.

166
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,364
Whose loan out?

167
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,242
It's fine. Really.

168
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,911
I...

169
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,663
...have a guy.

170
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,541
Okay.

171
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,753
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in New Mexico?

172
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:01,049
There's very specific paperwork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

173
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,011
Yes. My guy is a top...

174
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,888
...guy.
- Who is he?

175
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,640
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

176
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:14,229
Walt, this money
has to be unimpeachable...

177
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,899
...when it reaches Hank and Marie.

178
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,484
And it is. It will be.

179
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,864
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

180
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,326
Jesus, Skyler,
do you really wanna know?

181
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,077
Do you really wanna know?

182
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,833
Really?

183
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,203
What a pleasure it is to have you.

184
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,748
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

185
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,293
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

186
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:23,131
Walt never told me how lucky he was...
Prior to recent unfortunate... events.

187
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,385
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers...

188
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,180
...only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

189
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:36,144
That's a joke. That's a joke.

190
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,939
It funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

191
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,692
Here, please, sit down.

192
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,239
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

193
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,658
Yes, I do. I have...

194
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,619
...concerns.

195
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,289
If we're going to go down this road...

196
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,542
...and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law...

197
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,838
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

198
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,177
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this...

199
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,847
...in a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

200
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,975
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

201
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:19,479
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

202
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,609
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans...

203
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,320
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually...

204
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,697
I know what money laundering is.

205
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,409
- Well.
- Yeah.

206
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:36,455
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

207
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:41,043
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

208
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,794
That's simple.

209
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:47,216
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

210
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,801
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

211
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,387
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.

212
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,559
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

213
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,228
There you have it.

214
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:03,607
I'll generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo...

215
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,320
...as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
I know a couple casino managers...

216
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,490
...who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

217
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,200
It's a win-win for everyone.

218
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,036
Yeah, but you can't sell that
for very long...

219
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

220
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,667
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion...

221
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:26,672
...then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

222
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,715
Investment in what?

223
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,717
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

224
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,011
Laser tag.

225
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,058
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
of rollicking fun...

226
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,727
...in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

227
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,772
Laser tag?

228
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:48,110
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests...

229
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,154
Yeah, no, no. I actually...
I know what it is.

230
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,408
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...

231
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,619
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

232
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,373
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

233
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:05,794
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people...

234
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,715
...buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

235
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:14,136
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

236
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,555
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

237
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,098
"Hey, everybody...

238
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:23,228
...Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue".

239
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,983
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends...

240
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,568
...the government?

241
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,572
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

242
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,116
I've been doing this
for a lot of years...

243
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,203
...successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

244
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,541
So thank you for stopping by.

245
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,436
You want a beer or something?

246
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,147
Or something?

247
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,107
What do you mean?

248
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,361
Like, beer.

249
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,113
I'm cleaned out of anything else.

250
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:21,119
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

251
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,288
Yeah.

252
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:30,212
I've heard it over and over
and over again.

253
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,716
You know,
don't you think it's ridiculous...

254
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:38,595
...that society says beer is okay...

255
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:43,475
...and a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

256
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:48,939
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely...

257
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,818
...from something
that lifts you off the ground?

258
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:02,786
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use...

259
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:06,415
...and I feel like crap because of it.

260
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:13,755
- I know, it's just...
- What?

261
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,178
I can't get caught using again.

262
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,267
See, the thing is...

263
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,938
...not to get caught.

264
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,485
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

265
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,783
Just a little gas in the tank...

266
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,039
...and suddenly
everything is interesting.

267
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,503
Man, I wish
I could make that feeling last.

268
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,177
Like I said, I got nothing here.

269
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:06,141
What if I could get some?

270
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,317
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Hey, baby.

271
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,529
Your nana brought you home... early.

272
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,450
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today?

273
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,662
I was, then I saw your car.

274
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:30,874
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

275
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,211
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

276
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,465
He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.

277
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:57,276
Jesse, this is Brock.

278
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,447
So you have a kid, huh?

279
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,116
What's up?

280
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,577
Brock, huh?

281
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,288
That's a cool name.

282
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,083
Here, give it up.

283
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:27,598
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

284
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,726
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

285
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:36,023
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

286
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,234
He's gonna go play with his Legos
and his cars.

287
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,320
- Say, "Bye, Jesse".
- Bye, Jesse.

288
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,990
Hope you had a good time
at Grandma's.

289
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,492
Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

290
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:48,827
The convertible one?

291
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,706
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

292
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:57,836
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man...

293
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,546
...is neither.

294
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:03,884
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown...

295
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,969
...but he knows what he's doing.

296
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,640
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

297
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,850
Well, it's a little late on that.

298
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,938
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

299
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,611
Skyler...

300
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,615
...this isn't just about
what happened before.

301
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:33,580
My involvement in this is ongoing.

302
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,542
Understand?

303
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,586
I can't just quit.

304
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:45,133
I have something of a contract.

305
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,303
But it's all very safe, professional.

306
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,514
Structured.

307
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,433
Like, I can't simply quit.

308
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,194
Where you going?

309
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,671
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt...

310
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,716
...at least do it right.

311
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,361
You worked here four years.

312
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,655
It's a business you understand.

313
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,074
It's a story people will believe.

314
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,577
Not laser tag, this.

315
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,872
This is what we buy.

316
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,166
You.

317
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,503
This is what you buy.

318
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:28,904
Yeah, I mean, there's free donuts.
Nothing's wrong with a free donut.

319
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:36,745
Hey, Jesse, right?

320
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,873
Brandon, Peter.
How goes it? Hanging in there?

321
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,084
Can we please, just...?

322
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,377
Dumb-ass.

323
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,089
Sorry, man.
I was trying to keep it on the DL.

324
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:51,343
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?

325
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,303
Do what?

326
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:57,015
You know, sell to her?

327
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,686
What are you two even doing here?

328
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,689
What do you mean?

329
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:08,318
You can't get your nut up to sell,
what's the point of even coming?

330
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,196
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.

331
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,574
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.

332
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:22,791
Whatever. Later.

333
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,046
Hey.

334
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,924
Dude needs to come into the fold.

335
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,093
Yup.

336
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:39,558
Hey, you know what?
I have magical powers.

337
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,268
You wanna see?

338
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,022
Ready?

339
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,526
That's not real.

340
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,696
It is real. All right,
do you wanna see something real?

341
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,489
Look at this. Watch this.

342
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:56,992
Ready?

343
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,000
You like that?

344
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:09,004
That's science and stuff,
makes it do that.

345
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,216
- Do it again.
- Let Jesse... eat his dinner, Brock.

346
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,219
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

347
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,971
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

348
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,432
Firecrackers?

349
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,311
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

350
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,773
- Who does tricks with firecrackers?
- Tomas.

351
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:32,236
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers,
huh? Who's Tomas?

352
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,030
- He's my kid brother.
- Yeah?

353
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,907
And we don't talk about him.

354
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,786
Come on, eat your food, Brock.

355
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,166
Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

356
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,085
Hey, that's mine.

357
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,339
That's it?
That's what you wanna buy?

358
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:55,300
People will believe it, at least.

359
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,594
I worked here for four years.

360
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,097
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?

361
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,517
Hey, how come you guys
always give air freshener?

362
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,811
I explicitly say, "No air freshener<i>"...</i>

363
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:10,107
...and every time, I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

364
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:14,611
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

365
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,948
It makes a better story
than your laser tag.

366
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,576
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

367
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,539
She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

368
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:29,626
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

369
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:33,422
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

370
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,425
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner...

371
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,803
...and it worked because I believed it,
all right?

372
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,139
Has nothing to do with the story.

373
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:46,393
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

374
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:47,853
There's no Danny here.

375
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:51,982
What in God's name is a Danny?

376
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:56,320
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

377
00:28:56,528 --> 00:29:01,116
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens...

378
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,994
...teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

379
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,913
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

380
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,541
When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble...

381
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,545
...he went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

382
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:17,716
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

383
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,762
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

384
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:27,518
That guy, the guy with the... eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

385
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:32,105
You buy this place, all you got
is a big building that squirts water.

386
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,609
You got no Danny here.

387
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,164
You wanna stay for dinner?

388
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:50,958
Yeah.

389
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,043
Thanks.

390
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,546
What time is it?

391
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,132
Early still.

392
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:04,263
So...

393
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,517
What?

394
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,023
Thought maybe if you're holding,
we can do something.

395
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,026
What?

396
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,155
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about.

397
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,200
- Maybe you had a line on some?
- Wait.

398
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,162
What?

399
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,124
Thought you said
the kid is coming home.

400
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:35,294
Yeah, in a few hours.

401
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:37,713
And you seriously wanna get high?

402
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,008
I don't know what
you're getting pissed about.

403
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,468
You're the one who brought it up.

404
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,347
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

405
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,474
What kind of mother are you?

406
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,018
What?

407
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:55,105
You heard me. What kind of mom
gets wasted with a kid to take care of?

408
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:02,654
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

409
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,781
You come in my house
and judge me?

410
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,202
Like you got no responsibilities
so it's okay for you?

411
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,786
What do you know about me?

412
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,664
I take care of my baby.
I'll do anything for him.

413
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:16,126
The day Brock was born, I swore...

414
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:20,214
...I won't let what happened to Tomas,
happen to my son.

415
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,009
I'll die first.

416
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,970
Sorry. I...

417
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:29,640
I just...

418
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:37,147
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

419
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,233
That's what you wanna do, then go.

420
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,151
It's not what I want.

421
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,531
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

422
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,169
We both were.

423
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,298
You're right...

424
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,760
...I don't know
what you've been through.

425
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,263
You can tell me if you want.

426
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,186
This whole neighbourhood's
run by gangs.

427
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:20,524
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

428
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:26,154
They sort of took Tomas in.

429
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,824
No dad around.

430
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,160
Eight years old...

431
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,205
...they got Tomas slinging.

432
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:37,958
Part of some crew.

433
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,504
Then when he was 10...

434
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:46,925
...for some initiation or something...

435
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:50,512
...they made him kill somebody.

436
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:57,686
I heard the rumours.
I didn't believe it at first.

437
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,482
But then I saw him like a week later.

438
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:09,364
And he told me, yeah, he did it.

439
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,452
They gave Tomas a gun.

440
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,413
Gave him a choice.

441
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,499
Him or some dude.

442
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,794
So he did it.

443
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:27,257
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

444
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,928
Who did he say he killed?

445
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,847
Some dealer.

446
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,227
From some outside crew.

447
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:43,148
Right around the corner from here,
over off of Central.

448
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:49,238
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

449
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:55,035
Off of Central?

450
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:59,289
Like over by the train tracks?

451
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,252
When was this?

452
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,713
Few months back.

453
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:13,095
What else did he tell you?

454
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,811
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

455
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,981
Shot him dead.

456
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,320
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

457
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,203
It won't happen again.

458
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,123
Not to my son.

459
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,601
Guess what.

460
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:06,190
People who say "guess what" and
then actually expect you to guess...

461
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,192
...I hate those people.

462
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,027
Well, I just heard...

463
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:14,948
...about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank...

464
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:18,535
...who is going to be released
at the... end of this week.

465
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,538
Isn't that fantastic?

466
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,083
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

467
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,462
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

468
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,255
Hey.

469
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:34,510
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

470
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,805
- I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
- Hank, this isn't about insurance.

471
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:43,435
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

472
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:47,356
- I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
- Hank, you get stronger every day.

473
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,566
You don't need to be in a hospital.

474
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,819
In this condition, yeah, I do.

475
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,906
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

476
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,952
- You'll have all the same... equipment.
- Same... equipment? What's that mean?

477
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:04,039
The... equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

478
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:07,292
You'll do your PT at home
and it'll be great...

479
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,254
...because you'll be home.

480
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,799
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

481
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,093
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

482
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:18,887
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

483
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:22,432
- I got you a new bed...
- A hospital bed?

484
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,393
Well...

485
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,271
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

486
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,231
Hank...

487
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:30,983
...you'll be home.

488
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:34,152
You get that out of my house.

489
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,321
You hear me, Marie?

490
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,906
Today.

491
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,535
- Hank...
- I leave this hospital...

492
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:45,539
...when I walk out of here.
You understand?

493
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,293
And not before.

494
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,922
What's a Danny?

495
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,924
Danny's an accomplice.

496
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:00,846
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering...

497
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,473
...who's paid to look the other way.

498
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:08,729
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell...

499
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,691
...without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

500
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,112
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

501
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,990
Easier said than done.

502
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,452
If we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

503
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,008
What about me?

504
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:42,846
What about you?

505
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,474
Me.

506
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,393
I'll be the Danny.

507
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,022
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

508
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,483
I'm capable of managing
a small business.

509
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,318
A legal business, not this.

510
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:57,945
Who else could we trust?

511
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,155
- No.
- Walt...

512
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,032
...I'm in this.

513
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,202
- And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
- No.

514
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,373
- You are not in this. You are not...
- We're married, how am I not in this?

515
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,042
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

516
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,761
Right?

517
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:30,936
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

518
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:39,236
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

519
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,657
So there's that.

520
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:11,602
Jesse. Jesse.

521
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,021
Respirator.

522
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,232
Right.

523
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,087
Yes?

524
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,307
Yes, all right. Okay.

525
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,352
Yeah, I'll be there.

526
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,523
What was that?

527
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,610
An invitation.

528
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,173
Walter, you're right on time.

529
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,509
Please, come in.

530
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,478
I hope you like paila marina.

531
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,356
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

532
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:45,404
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

533
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:53,412
Come on. You can help me cook.

534
00:40:55,038 --> 00:41:00,586
This is a Chilean dish that I love...

535
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,255
...but I never get to make it.

536
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,591
Kids won't eat it.

537
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,343
But...

538
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,929
...you know how that is.

539
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,765
Sure.

540
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,062
Do you mind?

541
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:22,774
Would you slice the garlic?

542
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,570
Very thin.

543
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,914
Why did you invite me here?

544
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,459
We're working together...

545
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,961
...why not break bread together?

546
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,466
Now, the garlic?

547
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:08,487
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

548
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,990
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

549
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,994
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

550
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,330
I mean, not very much at all.

551
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:23,919
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal...

552
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,422
...instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

553
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:28,882
How is that possible?

554
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,511
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

555
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,474
Neural connections are formed.

556
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:43,230
The senses make the neurons
express signals...

557
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:48,443
...that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

558
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,904
Where memory is stored.

559
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:56,660
It's something called
relational memory.

560
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,291
Don't quote me on that, I'm...

561
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,335
I'm rusty on my biology.

562
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,796
That's very interesting.

563
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,593
Walter...

564
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,220
...I would like to help you, if I could.

565
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,266
Help me how?

566
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,978
Well, when I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

567
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,064
More than I care to admit.

568
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,693
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me...

569
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,614
...because this life of ours...

570
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:36,617
...it can overwhelm.

571
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:43,415
You are a wealthy man now.

572
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,919
And one must learn to be rich.

573
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:50,422
To be poor, anyone can manage.

574
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,386
What advice do you have for me?

575
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:01,767
Never make the same mistake twice.

576
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,310
Hey.

577
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:47,604
What's up?

578
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,774
You...? You Tomas?

579
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,818
I heard you were the man.

580
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:54,778
Yeah, what you want?

581
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:00,033
Crystal.

582
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,286
You think you could hook me up?

583
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:06,206
- Three hundred.
- For a teenth?

584
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:08,542
Shit, come on, yo.

585
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,878
Three hundred.

586
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,193
Hey, what's up?

587
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,412
Hey, yo.

588
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,726
Bounce.
