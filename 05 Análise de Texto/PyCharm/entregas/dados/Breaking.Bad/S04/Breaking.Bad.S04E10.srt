1
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,478
You can do this.

2
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,314
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

3
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,818
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

4
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:36,906
Third try.
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.

5
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,536
I really wanted to do this together
but I can hear him getting up.

6
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,622
It's not like I can keep him
from seeing the thing.

7
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,668
So, I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and I...

8
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,546
I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead
without you.

9
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,424
So call me.

10
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:03,850
- Hey.
- Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.

11
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,977
Thanks, Mom.

12
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,729
Of course,
I thought you might sleep through it.

13
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,484
So since it's almost, oh, noon...

14
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:18,990
...I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

15
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,910
- Pancakes?
- Pancakes it is.

16
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,620
Oh, could you do me a favor?

17
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,498
I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab it for me?

18
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,542
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,308
Surprise.

20
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,979
It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty slick, huh?

21
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:56,360
Yeah. Thanks, Mom. it's... it's great.

22
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,529
I really did a lot of research...

23
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,908
...and, I don't know,
this car just really stood out to me.

24
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,704
It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

25
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,708
It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with all your friends.

26
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,128
And, of course,
it is safe because I'm still your mother.

27
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,838
And it has a CD player...

28
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,841
...so you can listen to tunes
while cruising around.

29
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:24,680
So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
You wanna take it for a spin?

30
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,059
Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.

31
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:33,856
Yeah, okay. Well, let's...
Let's get those pancakes going.

32
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,445
Saul, he's here.

33
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,116
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

34
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,868
Saul?

35
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,747
Send him in.

36
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,420
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

37
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,674
Hey. Yeah, hi.

38
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,759
Have a seat, please.

39
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,261
L...

40
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,514
I don't understand why I'm here.

41
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,184
- Something to do with my creditors?
- Creditors? No.

42
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:15,272
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
I have some bad news.

43
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,109
Nothing but lately.

44
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,820
Your great-aunt Birgit passed away.

45
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,989
I'm sorry, who?

46
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,868
Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

47
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,454
And this was... Wow, eight years ago.

48
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,083
I just assumed you two were close,
given that...

49
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,461
Well, maybe this is good news.

50
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,423
Birgit left behind a sizable estate...

51
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,051
...of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

52
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,261
What?

53
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,140
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting...

54
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,102
...while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

55
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,983
Well, I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg.

56
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,236
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

57
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,531
Well...

58
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:12,621
Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

59
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,249
They traced the inheritance
to your father.

60
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,253
But having passed... My condolences.
...you are the next in line...

61
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:26,260
...to the tune of $621,552.33.

62
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,093
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

63
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,304
Let's see how the cook goes first.

64
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,473
Who's the chemist?

65
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,478
Is this a joke?

66
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,148
He's asking if you're the chemist.

67
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,524
I'm one of them.

68
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,694
Okay, we've all met.

69
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,155
Let's get to work.

70
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,057
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

71
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,145
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

72
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,522
We synthesize it ourselves.

73
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,816
All the ingredients are here.

74
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,945
They synthesize their own.

75
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,239
What?

76
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,535
I don't do that.

77
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,370
What's the problem?

78
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,750
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

79
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,086
That's how I know how to do it.

80
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,384
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression
that the phenylacetic acid...

81
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,096
...would already be synthesized
upon his arrival.

82
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,516
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

83
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,853
What kind of amateur
have you brought us?

84
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,272
- What's he saying?
- We're working it out.

85
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,482
This is ridiculous.

86
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,442
I'm not letting some infant...

87
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,487
...who can't even synthesize
phenylacetic acid...

88
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,239
...teach me my business.

89
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,451
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product...

90
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,956
...he's gotta do it my way.
The right way.

91
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,587
I speak English.

92
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,757
So you understand
what "asshole" means.

93
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,762
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
asshole.

94
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,182
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

95
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,061
I don't know. I have no idea.
Several hours, at least.

96
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,274
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

97
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,734
Don't you have standards?

98
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
I mean, this place is disgusting.

99
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,909
All right, we're gonna scour every vat,
every tank, every cook surface.

100
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:25,749
We clean up every possible source
of contamination. And then we cook.

101
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,632
Who do you think you are?

102
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,722
I'm the guy your boss brought here
to show you how it's done.

103
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,058
And if this is how you run your lab,
no wonder.

104
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:48,397
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
Now, if you don't want that to happen...

105
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:54,987
...I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch, and do what I say.

106
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,878
Clean up!

107
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,402
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

108
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,530
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

109
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,701
Dad, you there?
I'm outside. Are you okay?

110
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,247
I know you're home, your car is here.

111
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,418
You missed my party which feels like
something's gotta be really wrong.

112
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:38,632
L... I'm gonna have to call 911.
I don't know what else to do.

113
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,562
Dad?

114
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,235
Come in, if you're coming in.

115
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,076
What happened to you?

116
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,206
What happened?

117
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,630
I got into a fight.

118
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,968
What do you mean, a fight?
Like...? What fight?

119
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,930
Are you gonna talk to me here?

120
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,142
What are you doing?

121
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,686
- I'm calling Mom.
- Don't do that.

122
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,190
Look, I...

123
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,028
I appreciate that you're concerned,
but I'm fine.

124
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,832
Just do not call your mother.

125
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,710
Why not?

126
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,589
Because...

127
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,051
...I was gambling.

128
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:10,724
If you tell your mother, I just...

129
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,894
I will never, never hear the end of it.

130
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,730
So please.

131
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:26,240
Can we just keep this between us?
Would you do that for me?

132
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,869
Just... Just keep it to yourself.

133
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,082
I don't understand.
How'd you get into a fight?

134
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,918
And with who?

135
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,685
I made a mistake.

136
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,361
It's my own fault.

137
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,369
- I had it coming.
- Dad...

138
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,580
...it's okay.

139
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,294
It's all my fault.

140
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,089
I just...

141
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,049
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,558
Dad.

143
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,269
Come here.

144
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,940
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

145
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,943
No. Hey, hey, no.

146
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,114
- It's okay. Come on, please. it's okay.
- No.

147
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,699
Look at me. Look at me.

148
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,037
It's okay. it is. Come on.

149
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,622
Come on.

150
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,132
It's... it's okay.

151
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,555
Hey.

152
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,100
How was your birthday?

153
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,687
Good. Get some rest.

154
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,814
Okay.

155
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,777
The new car...

156
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,988
...did you drive it here?

157
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,157
Yeah.

158
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,037
That's good.

159
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,248
You like it?

160
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,588
Sure. I do.

161
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,925
It drives great.

162
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,803
That's good, Jesse.

163
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,983
Yes.

164
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,819
- Yes.
- Well done.

165
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,366
The first of many.

166
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,204
Yeah? What's that mean?

167
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,874
You're staying.
You belong to the cartel now.

168
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,928
You can't come to my work like this.
You're too recognizable.

169
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:45,058
Your face is plastered on every
bus bench within a five-mile radius.

170
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:49,062
Celebrities have to get their cars
washed just like everybody else.

171
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,606
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

172
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,733
- Okay?
- What is it?

173
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,904
Well, I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke. Right?

174
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,616
Which, I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

175
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,579
Yes, but it is better than prison,
correct?

176
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,332
Marginally. Which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

177
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,625
All right, good.

178
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,211
Yeah. I can't believe
he actually bought it.

179
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,006
Great-aunt Birgit. What?

180
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,593
But you called it. People see zeroes
dance before their eyes...

181
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,804
- ...it's like highway hypnosis.
- So, what's the problem?

182
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,892
Let's just say, you and I don't
wear the same rose-colored glasses...

183
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,102
...where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned.

184
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,981
So I kept an eye on his bank accounts,
and pulled his credit report.

185
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,276
If you would, note the time on that.

186
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:43,158
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.

187
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:48,204
- Three hours after leaving my office.
- He bought a Mercedes SL550.

188
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,916
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4500 down.

189
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,918
He's gonna pay 1830 a month.

190
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,129
Fully loaded.
He even got the heated steering wheel.

191
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,300
But that's upwards of 6300
that won't be going to the IRS.

192
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,513
I just thought you might like to know,
loath as I am to say, I told you so.

193
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,188
Where is he now?

194
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,956
Hey.

195
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,211
How you doing?

196
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,340
Good.

197
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,684
How are you?

198
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

199
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,525
I called her last night.

200
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,653
Oh, God.

201
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,741
I told her
I was spending the night at Louis'.

202
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,619
It's cool. So...

203
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,873
How are you?

204
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,378
I'm fine, son. I...

205
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,258
I...

206
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,595
Well, I...

207
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,932
I took these painkillers
that I had leftover from my surgery...

208
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,769
...and I made the brilliant decision...

209
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,314
...to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

210
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:25,070
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit.

211
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,363
But I'm fine.

212
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,701
I wish I could take back last night.
It was your birthday.

213
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,662
- This shouldn't be on your mind.
- It's okay.

214
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,872
No, it's not okay.

215
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,669
I'm your father,
and I don't want last night to be...

216
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,924
I mean, you really...

217
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:51,137
...can't think of me like...

218
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,640
Like what?

219
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,355
I don't understand.

220
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,077
My father died when I was 6.

221
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,996
- You knew that, right?
- Yeah.

222
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,627
He had Huntington's disease. it's...

223
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,924
it destroys portions of the brain...

224
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,009
...affects muscle control...

225
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,638
...leads to dementia,
it's just a nasty disease.

226
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,390
It's genetic.

227
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,185
Terrified my mother
that I might have it...

228
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,982
...so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid, but I came up clean.

229
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,611
My father fell very ill when I was...

230
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,947
...four or 5.

231
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,825
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

232
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,411
My...

233
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:03,793
My mother would tell me
so many stories about my father.

234
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,046
She would talk about him
all the time.

235
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,508
I knew about his personality...

236
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,427
...how he treated people...

237
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,846
...I even knew how
he liked his steaks cooked.

238
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,639
Medium rare.

239
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,474
Just like you.

240
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,771
I knew things about my father.

241
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,440
I had a lot of information.

242
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:29,152
It's because people
would tell me these things.

243
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,614
They would paint this picture...

244
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,074
...of my father for me.

245
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,955
And I always pretended
that was who I saw too.

246
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,626
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.

247
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:49,422
In truth, I only have one real...

248
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,759
...actual memory of my father.

249
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,014
It must have been
right before he died.

250
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,017
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him.

251
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,938
And I remember the smell
in there, the chemicals.

252
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,857
It was as if they used up...

253
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:12,987
...every single cleaning product
they could find in a 50-mile radius.

254
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,492
Like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

255
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,329
There was this stench
of Lysol and bleach.

256
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,207
I mean, you could just feel it
coating your lungs.

257
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,087
Anyway, there lying on the bed...

258
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,256
...is my father.

259
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,134
He's all...

260
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,887
He's all twisted up.

261
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,100
And my mom...

262
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,561
...she puts me on her lap.

263
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:50,358
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

264
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,737
But really, he just scares me.

265
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,910
And he's looking right at me...

266
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,624
...but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

267
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,091
And your grandmother is talking...

268
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,428
...trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does...

269
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,223
...but the only thing
I could remember...

270
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,352
...is him breathing.

271
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,690
This...

272
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,737
This rattling sound.

273
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,532
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray paint can.

274
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,791
Like there was nothing in him.

275
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,006
Anyway...

276
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,889
...that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

277
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,606
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

278
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:19,113
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

279
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,910
Remembering you that way...

280
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,414
...wouldn't be so bad.

281
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:34,295
The bad way to remember you
would be the way...

282
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,882
The way you've been
this whole last year.

283
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,345
At least last night you were...

284
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,391
You were real, you know?

285
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,234
- Bye.
- Bye.

286
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,265
Somewhere you should be?

287
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,396
Well, basically
it was a temporary hiatus.

288
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:37,108
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 100 percent.

289
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,570
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

290
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,157
- Hi.
- Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

291
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,076
Okay. You bet.
Say hi to the kids for me.

292
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,245
- Hey.
- Hi.

293
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,665
Nice surprise. What's up?

294
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,334
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

295
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,922
Well, things are...
Things took a turn. it's kind of crazy.

296
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,174
Oh, yeah?

297
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,177
The universe is telling me something.
I got some good news.

298
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,429
Some very good news...

299
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,724
...and I'm getting the business
going again.

300
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,270
I figure we haven't been down long...

301
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,648
...so we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

302
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,026
Oh, thank you. That's...

303
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,237
Gosh, that's...

304
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,198
That's wow.

305
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,742
How is that even possible?

306
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:34,290
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

307
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,293
I guess someone's
looking out for me.

308
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,045
I guess so.

309
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,175
Is that yours, outside?

310
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,677
Yeah, well, you know...

311
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,846
...I can't be driving a piece of crap.

312
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,057
You got to present
that successful image.

313
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:56,062
Right. So the IRS stuff.
That's resolved?

314
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,813
Yeah, it's in progress.

315
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,190
So you paid them?

316
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,526
Well, not yet, but I will.

317
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,569
When?

318
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,572
Well, it's not that simple.

319
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:11,869
Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

320
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,246
So I was thinking...

321
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,291
...I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

322
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,545
There will never
be a better deal, Ted.

323
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,047
The deal is you pay
your back taxes...

324
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,175
...you pay your penalty,
and you don't go to prison.

325
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,345
That's a good deal. So...

326
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,264
Let's keep our priorities straight.

327
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,352
Well, my priority
is getting my business back.

328
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,982
And putting my employees back on the
payroll so they can pay their mortgages.

329
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,443
Right. But I think
your employees would agree...

330
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,780
...that you need to get
your financial situation in control...

331
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,074
...before you can help them.

332
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,660
Boy, the IRS
got you on commission?

333
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,371
I'm just saying that,
though I really understand...

334
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,541
...the temptation
to restart the business...

335
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,585
...maybe the universe is telling you...

336
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,296
...that you need to pay what you owe.

337
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,633
Skyler...

338
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,677
...this is my money.

339
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,058
Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

340
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,645
A decision you made, by the way.

341
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,107
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

342
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,986
- Ted, this affects both of us.
- No it doesn't.

343
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,779
I'm telling you to drop this.

344
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,616
You need to use that money
to pay your bill.

345
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,242
By the end of this month.

346
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,329
Which you promised
the IRS in writing that you would do.

347
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,290
It is that simple.

348
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,876
Okay.

349
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,879
Okay, duly noted.

350
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,631
What does that mean?

351
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,343
Does that mean yes? Because
I really need a yes here, Ted.

352
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,679
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means. it means...

353
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,682
...in the most respectful way possible,
there's the door.

354
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,352
And I'm inviting you to, you know...

355
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,772
And thank you for your concern,
but I'm done talking about this.

356
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,805
From whom exactly do you think
you got that 600,000, Ted?

357
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,518
Great-aunt Birgit?

358
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,521
That was you?

359
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,273
Yeah.

360
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,521
What is this shit?

361
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,440
I don't get a vote?

362
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,067
I'm supposed to just
stay down here forever?

363
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,821
I promise you this:

364
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:38,159
Either we're all going home
or none of us are.

365
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,078
Now settle down.

366
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,752
On your feet.

367
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,520
Gustavo.

368
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,772
I'm so happy...

369
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,234
...you finally came to your senses.

370
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,077
May I present the cook.

371
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,916
This is your new employer.

372
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,293
You address him as Don Eladio.

373
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,712
It's a term of respect.

374
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,007
Hello, young man.

375
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:23,806
He doesn't speak
a word of Spanish, does he?

376
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,850
And he's no chemist...

377
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,518
...I'll tell you that.

378
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:32,982
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

379
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,986
He cooks better meth than you do...

380
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,198
...with all your fancy
college degrees.

381
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,911
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

382
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,254
What's in there?

383
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,172
A gift?

384
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:07,558
Gustavo, you're so generous.

385
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,894
It's a token of respect.

386
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,479
In honor of our renewed friendship.

387
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,075
Let's see what's in here.

388
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,917
No, impossible!

389
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,214
Zafiro Añejo!

390
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,091
Look at this.

391
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,803
Even the bottle is a work of art.

392
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,805
It's perfection!

393
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,058
Perhaps...

394
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,936
...it's too good to share.

395
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,021
What do you think, Gustavo?

396
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,609
It's yours to do with as you choose.

397
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,906
I choose...

398
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,908
...to drink it!

399
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,008
Careful.

400
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,260
That's beautiful stuff.

401
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,096
If you spill a drop...

402
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,473
...I'll cut off your hand.

403
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,726
Come on, hurry up.

404
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,813
Gustavo.

405
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,196
Welcome to Mexico.

406
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,950
Now you say:

407
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,999
This one's an addict.

408
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,584
To work, he must be sober.

409
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,171
None for you!

410
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,247
Enough business!

411
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,666
Bring the girls!

412
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,117
No. No, no, I don't...

413
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,263
Gustavo.

414
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,391
Cheer up, man.

415
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,851
Gustavo...

416
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,270
...I'm not angry.

417
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,357
I had to spank you.

418
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,527
But what choice did I have?

419
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,739
Look, once every 20 years...

420
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,242
...you forget your place.

421
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,085
There's no place for emotion in this.

422
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,214
You of all people should understand.

423
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:11,135
Business is business.

424
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,805
If you'll excuse me.

425
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,432
- Where are you going?
- To use your bathroom.

426
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,601
If I may.

427
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,731
Miguel!

428
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,360
Show Gustavo the pisser.

429
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,446
And make sure he doesn't get lost.

430
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,873
Hurry up.

431
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,070
Make yourself useful. Find a gun.

432
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,053
Don Eladio is dead!

433
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,514
His capos are dead!

434
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:49,227
You have no one left to fight for!

435
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,105
Fill your pockets...

436
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,107
...and leave in peace!

437
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,861
Or fight me...

438
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,613
...and die!

439
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,283
I hope to hell that works.

440
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,118
Take him.

441
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,102
Keys.

442
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,189
No. No.

443
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,567
Okay. Okay.

444
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,449
Hey. Hey, you still with us?

445
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,076
Go.

446
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,307
Kid, get us out of here, kid.

447
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,811
Come on.
