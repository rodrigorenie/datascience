1
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,368
I got it, I got it.

2
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,705
You're like a bee at a damn picnic,
Marie.

3
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,208
- Morning.
- Hey, buddy.

4
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,170
- Ready to get your rocks on?
- See? I knew it.

5
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,048
"Mineral show" is just some sort of
guy code for "strip club."

6
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,634
Yeah. You got your singles?

7
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,304
- Got it?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,684
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?

9
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,521
Cram one more giant geode in here,
we'll be sleeping in the garage.

10
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,024
- Got it. I got it.
- I'm sorry.

11
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,116
Christ. Longest week ever.

12
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,912
Here's just hoping
we get something good.

13
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,498
Keep your fingers crossed.

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,838
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,841
It's more like Rocky, you know?

16
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,146
Get the bad guy.

17
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,192
Yeah!

18
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,786
- But... What are you doing, buddy?
- Leaving.

19
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,748
You gotta go inside, order something
like last time. Avoid suspicion.

20
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,293
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.

21
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,629
We'll use the drive-through.

22
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,472
All right, baby,
let's see what we got.

23
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,076
What the hell? Look at this.

24
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,624
That's work. That's home.
That's work, that's home.

25
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,043
What, this guy...

26
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,462
...he goes two places every day,
all week?

27
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,923
It's unbelievable.

28
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,551
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.

29
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:26,933
Hank, is it possible that maybe,
just maybe...

30
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,727
...he's not your guy?

31
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,022
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.

32
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,276
What's the play here, buddy?

33
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,071
How do I get this guy?

34
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,365
Yeah.

35
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,200
How?

36
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,928
Yes, hi.

37
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:51,017
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place and I want to report...

38
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,230
He's sitting in a blue sedan...

39
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,735
...and he's been staring at
a particular house for a very long time.

40
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,528
Thank you. Thank you so much.

41
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,656
If you would, I would appreciate it.

42
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,066
All right.

43
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,818
I guess we'd better get started.

44
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,945
I already did.

45
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,783
Yeah?

46
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,331
Hey.

47
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,252
Got one of those for me?

48
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,172
- One of those what?
- Cigarette.

49
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,262
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.

50
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,811
Just give me one.

51
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,879
So, what have you been up to?

52
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,673
What?

53
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:50,928
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?

54
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,516
Go home. watch TV.

55
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,226
What do you watch?

56
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,936
I don't know, stuff.

57
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,272
Well, like what?

58
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,778
Like lce Road Truckers.

59
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,364
Ice Road Truckers.

60
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,116
What happens on that one?

61
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,452
Guys drive on ice.

62
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,878
I am gonna do it.

63
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,887
You gotta inhale, by the way.

64
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,393
What the hell, man? Don't you have
enough cancer already? Look.

65
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,146
I said...

66
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,358
...I'd do it. I'll do it.

67
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,403
Yeah, well...

68
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,530
...what does it matter?

69
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,200
We're both dead men anyway.

70
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,153
- Hi.
- Hi.

71
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,697
Am I catching you at a bad time?

72
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,325
No. I have a few minutes.

73
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,827
So Mr.
I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone...

74
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,831
...doesn't want a big birthday,
just wants to hang out with friends...

75
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,918
- ...which is fine by me. You?
- Fine by me.

76
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:51,590
Okay. So I figured a low-key family
dinner, no official party...

77
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,759
...and we bite the bullet...

78
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,595
...and buy him a car.

79
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,015
Used, I was thinking, would be best.

80
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:05,312
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.

81
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,857
Do you have any thoughts
on what kind?

82
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,777
Or should I just go ahead and...

83
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,780
Yeah. You just go ahead.

84
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,657
Okay.

85
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,746
Listen, on another subject,
I just wanted to tell you...

86
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,957
...that business is good.

87
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,293
Really good.

88
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,714
So good that I'm thinking, maybe...

89
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,091
...you don't need to even work...

90
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,593
...your second job.

91
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,519
- You're turning a profit?
- We're coming close.

92
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:51,275
Give us another month or two and,
yeah, we'll be there.

93
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,320
All of this to say...

94
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,699
...maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

95
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,746
I'm working on it.

96
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,875
Okay.

97
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,866
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Wake you?

98
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,661
No, Hank. I'm up.

99
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,581
Good. What you doing?

100
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,249
I'm...

101
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,378
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.

102
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,714
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.

103
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,883
One restaurant, home,
back and forth?

104
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,177
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit...

105
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,888
...because he owns
13 other restaurants. Right?

106
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,183
So I start thinking
about this little empire of his.

107
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,229
Fourteen restaurants. Who supplies
them? What's the base of operations?

108
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,606
So I do a little digging, and bingo.

109
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,484
Polios Hermanos
has a main distribution center.

110
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,236
It's not far from town.

111
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,946
The place is huge. I mean...

112
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,783
...I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse...

113
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,703
...and rows
of these long, poultry buildings...

114
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,081
...or hatcheries,
whatever you call them.

115
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,794
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?

116
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:40,259
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?

117
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,181
You know, Hank, I'm... I'm... I'm...

118
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,269
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm...

119
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,188
You know, I won't lie.

120
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,567
You've caught me somewhat...

121
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,319
...indisposed.

122
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,573
What do you mean,
like taking-a-dump indisposed?

123
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,286
Yeah. That's embarrassing.

124
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,787
That's it.

125
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:14,042
You know, it's just upset stomach and,
you know, everything...

126
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,212
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.

127
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,383
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex...

128
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,261
- ...at the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

129
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,305
You don't have to paint a picture.

130
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,849
One guy in a diaper is enough
for this trip.

131
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,560
- Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
- Hey, don't be.

132
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:36,273
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.

133
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,945
- Another ride?
- Yeah.

134
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,865
I'm sure I can get someone else
to take me.

135
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,242
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.

136
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,622
Well, look, I'm...
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.

137
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,874
Maybe 48 hours at the most.

138
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:59,838
And do you think you can possibly
hold off for a day or two?

139
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,509
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I...

140
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,720
You know, I just...
I would just really...

141
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,265
...love to be the one
to be able to take you there.

142
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,144
And, I mean, I've just really...

143
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,981
...enjoyed, you know,
the time with you...

144
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,193
- ...and helping you and...
- Well, yeah.

145
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,530
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.

146
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,200
Just, you know, give me a call
when you're feeling up to it.

147
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,662
Thank you. I will. Okay.

148
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,330
Bye.

149
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,980
- Yeah.
- Mike, listen.

150
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,275
I just want to say first off,
don't be angry.

151
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,693
What is it, Walter?

152
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,572
My brother-in-law, my DE... He...

153
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,285
Soon, he will probably,
in the near future...

154
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,621
...take a ride out
to a certain distribution center...

155
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:19,001
...to look around for things.

156
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,669
Just...

157
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,424
...look around for things. And, yeah.

158
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,598
Mike?

159
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,869
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

160
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,383
Thank you. Please give this
to your car-care professional.

161
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,064
So a hand wax for you today?

162
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,899
Okay, great.

163
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,947
Please give this
to your car-care professional.

164
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,493
And the black Explorer,
we could shampoo your floor mats...

165
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,496
...but deluxe detailing
is the best for your buck.

166
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,415
And SUV's are extra.

167
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,960
And please give this
to your car-care professional.

168
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,295
Thank you.

169
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,299
Please give this
to your car-care professional.

170
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,805
Hey, Sky.

171
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,058
Oh, my God. Ted.

172
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,518
What are you...?

173
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,311
Someone from the office...

174
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,482
...said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.

175
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,733
Well...

176
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,027
...hello.

177
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,737
You look great.

178
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,991
No. No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.

179
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,369
Not at all. You look happy.

180
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,038
Last time I saw you...

181
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,336
Hi, there.

182
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,380
I guess, Skyler...

183
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,801
...I'm gonna need to talk to you.

184
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:41,643
Ted, I really don't think
we have anything to talk about.

185
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,146
Actually, we do.

186
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,651
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

187
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,281
- How long have you had this?
- A while.

188
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,784
I debated, you know, contacting you.

189
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,454
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?

190
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,539
Ted, this is...

191
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,666
This is the CID.

192
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,544
The criminal division.

193
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,798
My God,
you're facing a felony charge here.

194
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,552
A $100,000 fine
on top of the taxes you already owe...

195
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,430
- ...plus five years in prison.
- Yeah.

196
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,973
- It's bad.
- Yeah.

197
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,435
It most certainly is.

198
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:28,690
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe...

199
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,276
...if you could help with this.

200
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,111
Help?

201
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,238
Help how?

202
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,825
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books...

203
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,662
...got the way they are,
maybe there's some way...

204
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,373
...you could undo what's in there.

205
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,335
You want me to uncook your books?

206
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:53,089
Maybe there's some method or some
accounting trick you could use...

207
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,176
Ted, it doesn't work like that.

208
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,428
The damage is already...

209
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,142
My name.

210
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,770
My signatures...

211
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,523
...are all over those books.

212
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,359
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.

213
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,237
Let me explain
what's going to happen here, okay?

214
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,406
Once the CID
sees this is willful tax fraud...

215
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,785
...they will build the strongest
possible case against you.

216
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:26,456
Once they start down that path, they
have an 80 percent conviction rate.

217
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,543
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail...

218
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,880
...and tap your phones,
and not just you, Ted...

219
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,300
...everyone involved in those books.

220
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,181
I can't have this in my life.

221
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,892
I cannot be audited.

222
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,646
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

223
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:53,149
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

224
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,696
No offense.

225
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,949
I'm sorry. I...

226
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,452
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?

227
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:10,125
I'm going to figure out
a way through this, somehow. Okay?

228
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,136
Here.

229
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,865
So is he gonna kill him?

230
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,454
Is who gonna kill who?

231
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,499
Gus.

232
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,753
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's
brother-in-law?

233
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,509
I mean, he's the reason
for all of this here, right?

234
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,767
Because it's totally logical for him
to off the dude.

235
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,440
A-hole DEA agent
poking around your junk.

236
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,611
Who needs that, right?

237
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,659
Makes sense to get rid of him
for good.

238
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,834
But killing a cop...

239
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,920
...I don't know.

240
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,757
It could look suspicious...

241
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:45,595
...if the dude who's investigating you
suddenly up and dies.

242
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,853
Then there's... There's Mr. White...

243
00:21:55,398 --> 00:22:02,070
...who would be even more apeshit
if he had family getting murdered.

244
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,952
He'd never cook for Gus again.

245
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,129
Guess there's a lot of angles
to consider.

246
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,721
If something were to happen to him,
would you have a problem with that?

247
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,228
Who really cares what I think?

248
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,910
Son of a bitch.

249
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,332
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

250
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,180
Hey.

251
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,431
Get down!

252
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,497
Tell them...

253
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,377
...the answer is "yes."

254
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,748
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

255
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,758
So, what? Is this going to be
a regular thing now?

256
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,470
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.

257
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,348
Just grab us a spare barrel,
Walter.

258
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,060
What was it this time?

259
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,146
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

260
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,482
Or did Gus need to send
another message?

261
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,942
Shut your mouth.

262
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,986
You shut your mouth
or I'll shut it for you.

263
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,449
I don't want you talking to me
or Jesse. Just get the barrel.

264
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,412
And if you ever plan on calling
the cops on one of my guys again...

265
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,750
...you go ahead and get two barrels.

266
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,540
Like...

267
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,086
...I guess I never thanked you for
what you did.

268
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,214
Thanks.

269
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,971
Next time don't stand there
like an idiot.

270
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,266
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.

271
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,977
But seriously, what...?

272
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,855
- What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?

273
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,151
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.

274
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,403
What the hell was he doing?

275
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,072
The cartel needs Gus.

276
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,492
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.

277
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,787
But, what? The rest of us are like
open season?

278
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,374
Is he doing anything about that,
or do we keep hanging out...

279
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,044
- ...for target practice while he...?
- Kid.

280
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:56,299
Enough. You got questions,
ask him yourself.

281
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,187
And here again.

282
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,023
Unreported income.

283
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,610
That's more than a year straight so far.

284
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:21,491
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

285
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,743
I'd have to...

286
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,748
...have a look at the copies of
the receipts to refresh my memory.

287
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,835
Take all the time you need,
Mr. Beneke. That's why we're here.

288
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,593
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

289
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,804
I got lost. Hey, Ted.

290
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,225
- Sky.
- This building is so confusing.

291
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,394
There are doors everywhere.

292
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,772
- Hi. You are...?
- Special Agent James Bekaris.

293
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,149
"Special." Skyler White.

294
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,570
Ms. white,
you are the accountant of record...

295
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,281
...for many of these reports,
is that correct?

296
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,826
- Guilty as charged.
- Can you shed light...

297
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,203
...on this history
of missing revenue?

298
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,747
Missing? No, it's there.

299
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,126
No. Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company...

300
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,421
...but it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

301
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,636
Let's take a look.

302
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,806
Oh, well, you know...

303
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,268
...this account here,
that is Mr. Keller's account.

304
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,104
And Mr. Keller is an old friend
of Ted's dad.

305
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,648
He always sends
an electronic payment...

306
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,568
...which I hate,
because I'm a real-paper person.

307
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,446
Mr. Keller is
one of those environmental people.

308
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,823
Since there wasn't
a physical check...

309
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,827
...I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.

310
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,124
Ms. white, you've read Section 61
of the lRC?

311
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,252
I did not follow what you just said.

312
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:01,257
How gross income for a business is
defined, you're not allowed to do that.

313
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,718
- Well, I think I am.
- No, you're not.

314
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:08,139
Well, you know what they say about
opinions, right? Everyone's got one.

315
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,017
But seriously, I am.

316
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,854
It doesn't matter if it's an
electronic check or a paper check...

317
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,194
When I input everything
into the Quicken...

318
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,531
...nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?

319
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,159
Quicken.

320
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:33,206
You used Quicken to manage books
for a business this size.

321
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,626
I did. Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.

322
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,379
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

323
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,466
- Ms. white, how did you get this job?
- Ted hired me.

324
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,927
No, I mean your qualifications.

325
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,555
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?

326
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,767
Well, I haven't had any training,
per se.

327
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,394
I've always been naturally good
with numbers.

328
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,023
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?

329
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:03,861
Right.

330
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,574
This is all falling into place now.

331
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,915
Ms. white, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...

332
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:20,044
- ...anywhere else, are you?
- Right now? No.

333
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,505
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

334
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,885
I'm not really clear about what
happened in there.

335
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,347
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law...

336
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,268
...doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.

337
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,728
Pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties...

338
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,565
...and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

339
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,441
Pay with what?

340
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,111
I owe them $617,000. What am I...?

341
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,323
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.

342
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:53,536
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW,
take out a second mortgage...

343
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,038
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

344
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,375
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.

345
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:03,170
Ted, if you don't pay them,
they will reopen the investigation...

346
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,842
...and that little fiction I just spun up
there is gonna completely unravel.

347
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,844
You have to settle.

348
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,891
Wish I could.

349
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,314
Come in.

350
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,290
I hope you brought an appetite.

351
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,878
Yeah, I guess.

352
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,259
Mike mentioned you have
some questions.

353
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,264
Yeah.

354
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,144
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.

355
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,277
Right on.

356
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,542
What am I doing here?

357
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,888
I know you have concerns.

358
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,685
What happened yesterday,
to my man at the farm...

359
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,812
...it was a terrible thing.

360
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,232
The dude getting his head
blown off? Yeah.

361
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,111
I've invited you into my home...

362
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:37,491
...prepared food
so we could sit and talk.

363
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,705
Discuss what's going on in
this business...

364
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,958
...our business, like men.

365
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,962
And I will explain everything
that is happening.

366
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,339
I will answer your questions.

367
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,092
But first...

368
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,680
...I need you
to answer one question for me.

369
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,393
Can you cook Walter's formula?

370
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,605
What?

371
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,524
Walter's formula.

372
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:15,029
Can you produce his product
without any help? Alone.

373
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,531
No.

374
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,952
Why?

375
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,915
You're asking me if I can cook
Mr. white's crystal?

376
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,667
Without him?

377
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,503
Me?

378
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,048
The junkie loser
you were about to waste...

379
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,467
...and dump in the desert
a month ago.

380
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,636
This your plan?

381
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,723
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is...

382
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,602
...be my buddy...

383
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,022
...and make me feel important.

384
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:57,488
Then get me to keep cooking for you
after you kill Mr. white?

385
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,159
You wanna...
You wanna talk like men?

386
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:08,207
Let's talk like men. You kill Mr. White,
you're gonna have to kill me too.

387
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,085
That is not what I asked you.

388
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:16,674
You are here because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

389
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,301
And I need your help.

390
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,347
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

391
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,392
Now, if you would...

392
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,854
...answer the question.

393
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,376
Hey, you headed out?

394
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,756
Yeah.

395
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:28,097
Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta
talk to you. I don't know if you're...

396
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:32,017
...with your family or whatever,
but this is important...

397
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,854
...so I'm hoping you could come over.

398
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,990
Thank God. Come on in.

399
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:52,997
- You... You want a beer or something?
- No.

400
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,126
- Should I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

401
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,045
Okay, so...

402
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,717
Okay, so word has come down
that they...

403
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,803
They want me to go to Mexico.

404
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,057
There's some...
Some sort of war brewing...

405
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,894
- ...between Gus and the cartel.
- "Word has come down"?

406
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,773
The cartel has been... Has been
messing with Gus' operation.

407
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,651
Like jacking trucks to,
like, send a message.

408
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,821
And yesterday,
that dude we brought to the lab.

409
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:30,576
I mean, they shot him right in
front of me. Just blew his head open.

410
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,371
Some sniper nailed him from
like a mile away.

411
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,834
Anyway, they've been holding
them off.

412
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,462
But between the cartel
taking potshots...

413
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,507
...and your brother-in-law trying
to throw a net over the whole deal...

414
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:49,511
...it's like what you call
a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.

415
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,307
So, Gus is... ls gonna cave.

416
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,020
So the cartel wants half
of Gus' entire operation...

417
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,774
...and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.

418
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:07,029
Well, I... I gotta give it to them. I mean,
I'm supposed to go to Mexico...

419
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,909
...and teach a bunch of cartel chemists
how to cook a batch of blue.

420
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,162
You know,
and Gus doesn't trust you...

421
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,248
...so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man...

422
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,002
...you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to...

423
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,256
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever...

424
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,926
...and they got like actual chemists...

425
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,179
...like cartel chemists asking me
chemistry stuff...

426
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,432
...that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you.

427
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,937
And what if all the equipment
is in Mexican instead of English?

428
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,399
You know?
I don't know. I don't know.

429
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,027
I mean, if I mess this up...

430
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,865
...I'm dead, you know? All of us.

431
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,539
Mr. white, look, I need...
l need your help.

432
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,835
Okay, maybe you could...
Maybe you could coach me...

433
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:07,840
...or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.

434
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,092
Mr. white?

435
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,011
So you saw Gus?

436
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,889
What? No.

437
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,143
- You didn't see Gus.
- No.

438
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,938
Then who told you all of that?

439
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,275
It was passed down, like I said.

440
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,154
"Passed down." By whom?

441
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,948
By... By Mike and them.

442
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:37,494
- I mean, they did. They...
- So "they" doesn't include Gus.

443
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,371
You haven't been with Gus.

444
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,583
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

445
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,086
- Why are you...?
- You weren't at Gus' house last night.

446
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,421
What?

447
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,426
What the hell? Jesus.

448
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,721
Still here.

449
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,892
- It's still here.
- Jesus.

450
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,316
You look me in the eye
and you tell me...

451
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,569
...that you weren't at his house
last night.

452
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,613
L...

453
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,492
Look, I didn't have a chance,
all right?

454
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,537
Okay? I knew you would react
this way.

455
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,916
I knew you would freak out
and wouldn't believe me.

456
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,543
That's why I didn't say anything.

457
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,130
Look, there was just this one
big pot of stew.

458
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,217
He just made this one big pot
and we both ate from it.

459
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,969
What was I supposed to do,
poison myself?

460
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,265
Two hours, 18 minutes, you couldn't
figure out a way to give it to him?

461
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,477
- He never left the room.
- You lying little shit!

462
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,230
You had one thing to do, one thing.

463
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,983
That is the only thing, I might add,
that would save our lives...

464
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,153
...and you were right there.
You were in his house...

465
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,156
...and you didn't have the guts
to do it.

466
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,537
Two hours and 18 minutes?

467
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,916
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

468
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,211
How did you know
I was at his house last night?

469
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,046
Were you following me?

470
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,970
This. This is how I knew.

471
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,228
- You bugged my car?
- 7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

472
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,399
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?

473
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,110
Not the slightest intention.

474
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,196
Everything that I have done for you.

475
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,949
You put a bug on my car?

476
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,743
I'm sorry,
after everything you've done for me?

477
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,954
What you've done for me?

478
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,373
You killed me, is what you've done!

479
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:51,169
You've signed my death warrant! Now
you want advice? I'll give you advice:

480
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,880
Go to Mexico and screw up
like I know you will.

481
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,425
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!

482
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,827
You son of a...

483
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,164
Can you walk?

484
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,168
Yeah.

485
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,005
Then get the fuck out of here
and never come back.
