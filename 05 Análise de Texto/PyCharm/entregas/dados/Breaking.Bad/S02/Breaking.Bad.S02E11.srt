1
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:35,032
What's up?
-How's it going?

2
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:41,456
All right.

3
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:07,899
What you need?

4
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:13,488
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

5
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:20,244
Yeah. Punk bitches.

6
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:07,125
<i>Please leave your message

<i>Record your message after the tone.

8
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:11,629
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,341
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,802
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,304
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,103
What's that thing in your ear?
-What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,314
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:39,884
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

15
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:43,304
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:44,764
Absolutely.

17
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,349
As you know...

18
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:49,560
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:53,523
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:58,236
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,238
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:03,116
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

23
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,910
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:08,454
He's got a good track record.

25
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,248
Pretty good.

26
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:13,000
It sounds...

27
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,420
...aggressive.

28
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,755
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:20,758
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

30
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,261
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,596
And it will.

32
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:29,475
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:32,770
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

34
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,440
...but that's all.

35
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:37,442
In my opinion...

36
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,944
...if you're willing to take some risk...

37
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:42,280
...then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:52,874
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,877
I'd say between 170-...

40
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,504
...and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:02,300
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

42
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:05,303
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

43
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:10,975
This is obviously a big decision...

44
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:14,479
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:16,898
No.

46
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,358
I'll do it.

47
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:29,327
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:33,623
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:41,005
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:44,300
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

51
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,302
...for another couple of weeks...

52
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,805
...and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,266
That's tricky.

54
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:58,523
When's the due date?
-It's the 21 st.

55
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,066
So two weeks and change?

56
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,485
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:05,822
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,367
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,370
Yeah.

60
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:32,056
Fourteen messages...

61
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,142
God.

62
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:38,688
<i>-Yeah.
-It's me.</i>

63
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,316
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:43,901
Working.

65
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,445
What is it?

66
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,199
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:52,410
<i>Shot.</i>

68
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,246
Which one is he?

69
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:58,082
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,752
<i>-Jesse, listen-
-That figures.</i>

71
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,058
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,894
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:21,272
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

74
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:25,276
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,782
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

76
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,784
...what'd you expect?

77
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:35,328
I don't know.

78
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,205
You don't know?

79
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,249
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:44,295
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,760
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,640
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

83
00:07:55,848 --> 00:08:00,269
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

84
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,730
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,817
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,404
We're on the verge...

87
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:13,825
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

88
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,494
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:22,333
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,294
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

91
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:28,381
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

92
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:31,884
...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
-Yeah?

93
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,845
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:37,014
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,521
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,360
Why didn't you say something?
-I don't know, man.

97
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,028
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:54,365
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,534
We'll get by.

100
00:08:56,743 --> 00:09:00,538
All right? We'll make it.
-Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,874
I'm out.

102
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:16,763
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,975
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,978
How about "your fault"?
-No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,356
You are in charge of distribution.
-You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,984
Doesn't mean you become careless.
-Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:33,071
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

108
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,907
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

109
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:38,159
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:42,455
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:47,585
It was some kind of turf dispute...

112
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:49,921
...and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,839
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:55,927
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

115
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:58,596
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,848
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,603
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,606
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:12,110
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:13,778
Better?

121
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,156
Yeah, it's...

122
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,413
...looking a little more positive.

123
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,373
I may have more time than I thought.

124
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,417
Outstanding.

125
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,919
Now, as to your dead guy:

126
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,921
occupational hazard.

127
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,381
Drug dealer getting shot?

128
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,635
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

129
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:40,930
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

130
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,309
Thirty-eight and change.

131
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,395
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

132
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:48,813
Pounds.

133
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,277
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

134
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,571
Guys!

135
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,656
Why the long faces here?

136
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,992
You're sitting on a gold mine.

137
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,286
A gold mine we can't sell.

138
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:05,788
We need a proper infrastructure.

139
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,332
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

140
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,376
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

141
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:13,671
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

142
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,840
Payback. That's what we need.

143
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,513
God.

144
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:27,643
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

145
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:34,692
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

146
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,403
We need your help.

147
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,699
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

148
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,576
Ready for this? Here goes.

149
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:47,705
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

150
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,375
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

151
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,002
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

152
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:57,632
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

153
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,051
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

154
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,887
What, some tattooed speed freak?

155
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,516
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

156
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,518
Somebody who treats your product...

157
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:12,105
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

158
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:15,525
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

159
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:20,071
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

160
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,908
You know someone like that?

161
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:28,079
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

162
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,164
Who knows another guy.

163
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:34,210
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

164
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,256
Well, what's his name?

165
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,050
I have no idea.

166
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:45,722
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

167
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,058
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

168
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,269
...he sounds a little like you.

169
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:59,068
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

170
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:01,863
<i>He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

171
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:05,116
<i>Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

172
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,870
<i>And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.</i>

173
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,122
I need you to leave.

174
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,091
Look, there's...

175
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:26,179
...some stuff about me
you don't know and...

176
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,726
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,063
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:40,401
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

179
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,160
One of my guys...

180
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:52,747
...a friend who worked for me...

181
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,124
...got murdered.

182
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,253
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:05,176
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

184
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:09,430
...being that you're in a programme
and all and...

185
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,477
You could come with me
to a meeting.

186
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,106
No.

187
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,817
No meetings.

188
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:25,279
We could just get out of here.

189
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:31,953
It won't help.
-Yeah, it will.

190
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,622
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,374
I just...

192
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:40,336
All right, I really just need you to go.

193
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:49,947
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

194
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:51,741
Thank you.

195
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,690
You're late.

196
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,485
Yeah.

197
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:30,488
We're in the big time now.

198
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,408
So where's the kingpin?

199
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,828
Your guess is as good as mine.

200
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:43,000
So you get the dude's name?

201
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,836
Nope.

202
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:48,297
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

203
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:51,592
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

204
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:57,181
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

205
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,642
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

206
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,519
...looking like a couple chumps?

207
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:04,522
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

208
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,274
Fine, thanks.

209
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:11,487
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

210
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,781
I don't get you, man.

211
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,785
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

212
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:22,331
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

213
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,292
Yeah, what about after?

214
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,879
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

215
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,548
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

216
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,884
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

217
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:36,679
Things have changed.
-Oh, I know.

218
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:39,307
We got a guy killed.

219
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,645
You know what?

220
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,356
This is bullshit.

221
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,401
I'm out of here.
-Hey.

222
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:03,414
I think she's waking up from a nap.

223
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:07,043
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

224
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,257
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

225
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,134
You're on the low side of normal.

226
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:17,929
What? How low?

227
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:21,265
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

228
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:24,977
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

229
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,939
Hey.

230
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:30,274
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

231
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,443
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

232
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,654
Sorry. Hi.
-Hi.

233
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,281
What did I miss?
-For your refrigerator.

234
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,575
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:40,993
Look at her.

236
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,620
Look.
-Yeah.

237
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,456
God. It's like she's here already.

238
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:49,252
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

239
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,671
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

240
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,798
It's time to make a decision.

241
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:57,135
You know what I'm gonna say.
-The C-section?

242
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:59,595
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

243
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:05,727
Well, my last labour
was pretty tough, so...

244
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:08,855
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,816
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:16,320
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

247
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,989
...a week from Friday?

248
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,660
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

249
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,208
We have a birthday.

250
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,252
The 16th.

251
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,588
I like it.
-Yeah.

252
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:37,091
You know, speaking of birthdays...

253
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,845
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

254
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,848
It's an hour before closing.

255
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,100
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

256
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,519
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

257
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,354
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

258
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,106
Why you?

259
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,819
Because I said I would...?

260
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,614
It is the least I can do.

261
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,742
Okay?
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

262
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,327
Bye.
-Bye.

263
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,919
Let's get out of here.

264
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,338
You know, go do something.

265
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,633
Seriously.

266
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:04,262
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

267
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,806
Let's take a drive.

268
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,437
Sure.

269
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,916
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

270
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,044
We're halfway through the job.

271
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:41,132
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

272
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:44,927
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

273
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,387
I gotta go.

274
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,598
Dean, I gotta go.

275
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,975
Okay, all right.

276
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,814
Happy birthday!

277
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,983
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,403
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

279
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,323
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

280
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:09,160
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

281
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,247
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

282
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:16,667
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

283
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,506
Wait. Skyler?
-Yes?

284
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:23,299
I wanna hear it first.

285
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,760
Absolutely not. No way.

286
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:28,221
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

287
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,182
Yes, I can. Watch me.
-Please!

288
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:35,186
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

289
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,856
Come on. It was so good last time.
-It was ages ago.

290
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:41,943
And I'm enormous now.

291
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,362
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

292
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,864
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

293
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:49,492
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

294
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,452
Seriously.
-Yes, come on, Skyler.

295
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:56,374
<i>-Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
-It's obscene.</i>

296
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:59,544
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>

297
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:15,226
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

298
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:22,066
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

299
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:29,824
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

300
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:34,328
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

301
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:38,916
<i>Happy birthday</i>

302
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,588
<i>To you</i>

303
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,260
That was fantastic.

304
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,304
Isn't she great, huh?

305
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,890
Okay, here we go.

306
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,613
<i>-He wasn't there.
-Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

307
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,366
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

308
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:12,700
Nobody came.

309
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,536
<i>All I know is my contact
said he was there.</i>

310
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,997
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

311
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,041
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

312
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:21,751
<i>-Where was he?
-Who knows?</i>

313
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,629
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

314
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,631
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

315
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,219
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

316
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,888
What? What do you mean?

317
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,473
No deal. No dice.

318
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,642
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

319
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,102
Wait a minute.

320
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,813
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

321
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:45,149
<i>I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?</i>

322
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:49,821
He's skittish, like a deer.

323
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,074
Call him back.

324
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:55,326
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

325
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,162
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

326
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,623
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

327
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,084
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

328
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,961
Second of all, it's over.

329
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:07,630
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual...</i>

330
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,216
<i>...all you get is the one shot.</i>

331
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:12,677
Look...

332
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,513
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

333
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,473
...but don't get your hopes up.

334
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,435
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

335
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:22,186
Damn it.

336
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,707
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

337
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,799
Can I help you, sir?

338
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,928
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:23,891
And five minutes of your time.

340
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,155
What can I do for you?
-Have a seat.

341
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,491
Please.

342
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:56,215
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,303
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:05,058
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,269
I believe that person was you.

346
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,023
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:14,776
I don't think I am.

348
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,740
Sir, if you have a complaint...

349
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:23,201
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,870
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:30,333
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

352
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,835
...is very careful.

353
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,046
A cautious man.

354
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,758
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:44,514
If you are who I think you are...

356
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,141
...you should give me another chance.

357
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,066
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,696
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,907
Your partner was late
and he was high.

360
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,828
Yes. Yes, he was.

361
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,832
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,212
You have poor judgement.

363
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,674
I can't work with someone
with poor judgement.

364
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:23,010
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,223
I've been told it's excellent.
-It is impeccable.

366
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:29,892
It is the purest...

367
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,563
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,107
That is not the only factor.

369
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:40,278
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

370
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,947
...and your customers would pay it.

371
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,241
Hands down.

372
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:52,415
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:54,625
You won't see him.

374
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,587
You won't interact with him.

375
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,797
Forget he exists.

376
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,634
I have to ask.

377
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,471
Why?

378
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,473
Why him?

379
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,686
Because he does what I say.

380
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,565
Because I can trust him.

381
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,319
How much product
do you have on hand?

382
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,988
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,824
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,916
Will I hear from you?

385
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,961
I have your numbers.

386
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,136
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,862
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

388
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,241
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,994
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,746
Dribs and drabs.

391
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,040
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

392
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,711
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,007
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,681
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,892
I found six other instances...

396
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,604
...of revenues being under-reported.

397
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:42,316
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,903
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

399
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,364
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,450
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,077
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

402
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,413
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

403
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,248
Obviously, we forgot...

404
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:01,461
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,922
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

406
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,760
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,220
Right.

408
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,014
Right...

409
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:17,852
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

410
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,438
...to try and sort this out.

411
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,610
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,113
In a few cases...

413
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,785
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,539
Ted.

415
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,343
All right.

416
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,721
You got me.

417
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:59,143
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,730
What are you thinking?
-I'm thinking...

419
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,108
...about saving a company.

420
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

421
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,112
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

422
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,615
...and their college funds
for their kids.

423
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,659
Not to mention my own.

424
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,453
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

425
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,330
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,457
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

427
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,961
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,629
If I don't keep up-
-Ted.

429
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,674
People go to prison for this.

430
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,766
My dad built this company
from nothing.

431
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,103
We make things here.

432
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,356
The people who work here
are like family.

433
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,652
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,324
Sky...

435
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,121
...don't report this.

436
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,707
Please.

437
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,587
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,886
But I can't be a part of it.

439
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,432
I know.

440
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,310
I know. I just wish...

441
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,146
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,108
I don't want you to go.

443
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,921
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

444
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,882
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

445
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,926
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

446
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,594
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

447
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,763
<i>Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.</i>

448
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,057
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...</i>

449
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,226
<i>...everyone was all choked up
and shit.</i>

450
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,104
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

451
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,272
<i>And you should have
seen the coffin.</i>

452
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,358
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

453
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,653
<i>I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

454
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,823
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

455
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,243
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

456
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,538
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

457
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,999
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,216
Hold that.

459
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,053
What's it feel like?

460
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,517
There's a chill.

461
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,978
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,730
And then...

463
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,065
You'll see.

464
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,488
I'll meet you there.

465
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,876
Take that off.

466
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,862
Phones off, please.

467
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,007
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,010
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,679
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,112
Yes.

471
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,003
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,506
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,134
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

474
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,221
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

475
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,972
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,016
Oh, owner. Okay.

477
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,977
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,480
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:27,235
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,154
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,449
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

482
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,493
No, no.

483
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,662
What's his name?
-Gustavo.

484
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,372
Gus.

485
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,581
Thank you.

486
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,296
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,967
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,510
One hour.
-What?

489
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,095
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,890
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

491
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,101
One hour. If you miss it...

492
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,020
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

493
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,863
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

494
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,199
<i>-Come on! Come on!
-Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

495
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:18,202
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

496
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,246
Pick up the phone.

497
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,791
I'm coming by. I need the product.

498
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,793
I need the product now.

499
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,676
Oh, God.

500
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,606
Jesse.

501
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,653
Jesse!

502
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,905
Jesse.

503
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,449
Jesse.

504
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,055
Jesse. Jesse.

505
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,016
Jesse.

506
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,999
Jesse.

507
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,792
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

508
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,669
Jesse.

509
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,006
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

510
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,340
Wake up!

511
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,134
Come on, damn it.

512
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,635
Wake up.

513
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,013
Where'd you put it?

514
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,973
Where's the product?
-Get off of me.

515
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,060
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

516
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,020
In the kitchen.
-Where?

517
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,856
Under the sink.

518
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:59,257
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
