1
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,893
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:54,998
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,267
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,947
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,950
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:25,029
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,967
Just remember
who you're working for.

8
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,506
What did you say?

9
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:36,508
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,277
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:43,148
Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,518
No, I'm just saying.

13
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:49,321
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:52,157
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,793
Is that it?

16
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:55,995
Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:59,398
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,871
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

19
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:14,013
Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:19,018
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela-

21
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:34,901
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:39,172
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:45,946
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,170
Adjusting for inflation...

25
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,072
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

26
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:45,808
...say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:51,979
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:56,185
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

29
00:04:56,385 --> 00:05:00,456
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,460
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

31
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,762
...say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:10,467
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,538
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:22,244
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,315
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,486
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:34,058
That is what I need.

38
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,627
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,663
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:45,401
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:50,775
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,234
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,020
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:43,562
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,996
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,534
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,402
Oh, damn, Tuco.
-Shut up!

48
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,906
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,577
Do something.
-Do something?

50
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,145
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,714
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:04,283
Do that-Do that thing.

53
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:10,756
No, there's not-There's nothing.

54
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,391
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,893
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:18,765
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,504
No.

58
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:58,806
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,174
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,177
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,218
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,354
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:51,626
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:13,415
What's the big hurry?

65
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:22,023
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.

66
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,125
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,775
You're done.

68
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:03,462
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:09,434
Hello?

70
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:24,883
<i>Are already married-</i>

71
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,485
Hello?

72
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,557
<i>Thank you to our viewers-</i>

73
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,659
Hey.

74
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,729
<i>The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>

75
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,599
Walt?

76
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:43,902
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:46,940
Walt.

78
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,280
Walt.

79
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,650
Hey.
-Hey yourself.

80
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,119
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,959
Are you okay?

82
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,362
Great.

83
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:14,934
New hat?

84
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,939
Yeah.

85
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,942
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,978
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

87
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:29,049
<i>But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...</i>

88
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,786
<i>...like airports, golf courses-</i>

89
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,004
Where've you been?

90
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,903
What is...?

91
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:28,043
What are you doing?

92
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,277
Okay.

93
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,616
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,852
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:40,056
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

96
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:43,192
Okay. Yeah, just...

97
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:45,861
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:49,132
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,467
Stop it!

100
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:45,254
I know you're scared...

101
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:50,728
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:56,801
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:05,677
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,189
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:25,826
Dead, man.

106
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,628
<i>Ruto or rute
or however the hell you-</i>

107
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,663
This is conjecture.
-This is conjecture?

108
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,798
Conjecture isn't helping.
-Conjecture-?

109
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:36,370
We need to state the facts.
-Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,673
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,642
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

112
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:44,212
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

113
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:46,847
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,616
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:53,453
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:58,092
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,128
And that way-
That way he just kept staring at us...

118
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:04,932
...saying, "You're done."

119
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,134
"You're done"?

120
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,970
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,039
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

122
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:14,843
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:17,278
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

124
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:21,949
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:27,422
What happens
when he decides "no"?

126
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,466
No.

127
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,436
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:53,614
How would you do it?
-What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:57,320
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

130
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,523
All right.

131
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:04,527
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:07,931
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:11,366
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:15,905
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:18,941
So three shots?

136
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,880
Three shots or, I don't know, two.
-Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,482
Two would probably work, I guess.
-Okay, two shots.

138
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:27,117
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,821
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:35,658
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

141
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,895
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

142
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,130
...he's probably coming at you, right?
-Yeah.

143
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:42,532
You turn toward him.
-Yeah, just wheel on him-

144
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:44,567
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:46,136
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,138
I don't know. Three shots.
-Three shots.

147
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:51,142
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,943
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,314
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150
00:18:57,548 --> 00:19:02,153
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:06,791
All right.

152
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:10,294
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,463
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:15,700
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,641
It's not-

156
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:35,187
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

157
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,023
...and you can't even open the gun?

158
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:45,565
It's not that easy, is it?
-Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

159
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:52,505
Yeah.

160
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,385
Call Skyler.

161
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:18,197
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

162
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:21,934
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

163
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:24,504
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

164
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:27,306
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

165
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:28,975
...over by UNM tonight...

166
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,676
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

167
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,980
Listen to me. "Hang."

168
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,484
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

169
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,252
I'm still hip.

170
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:42,556
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

171
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,659
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

172
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:51,031
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

173
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:56,235
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

174
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:59,139
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

175
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:04,044
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

176
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,748
I wonder if that ever happens.

177
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:10,517
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

178
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,022
Skyler didn't pick up?

179
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,424
Obviously she's not home.

180
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:27,534
Baby. Baby, wait up.

181
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,038
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

182
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,207
Dinner tonight. That new place.

183
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:36,211
How late they serve?
-I don't know.

184
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,279
You got Dave at 8.

185
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,551
Not tonight.
-Yeah, you do. Remember?

186
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,320
No, that's Thursday.

187
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:50,024
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

188
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,494
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

189
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,331
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

190
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,633
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

191
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:58,968
And I'm doing them, Hank.

192
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,103
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

193
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:05,508
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

194
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,910
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

195
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:20,523
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

196
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,426
Oh, boy. I...

197
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:27,897
I think Dave is really helping you.

198
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,468
Yeah.

199
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:34,437
Yeah.

200
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:49,719
Sorry about that.

201
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:59,563
She's...

202
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:08,538
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

203
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,276
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

204
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,013
...and then he says, "Give me a four."
-Hey, Gomez.

205
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:18,749
Gomez? What do you got for me?

206
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:20,985
Come on. Chop-chop.

207
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,588
Good morning to you too.

208
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:30,461
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

209
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,597
You know Southwest Aniline, right?
-Yeah, off the 25?

210
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,032
The place smells like feet.

211
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,502
This is them. Check this out.

212
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:44,376
Holy shit. What was that?
-Thermite. So they tell me.

213
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:46,345
Burns about 5000 degrees.

214
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:48,546
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

215
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:52,417
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

216
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:57,688
Wait. I take that back.

217
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:01,693
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

218
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:05,630
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

219
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,633
It rolls. Jesus.

220
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,805
So, what'd they get?
-Methylamine, 30 gallons.

221
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:16,209
P2P?

222
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:19,278
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

223
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,180
Who the hell still does that?

224
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,184
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

225
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,919
Pseudo's in short supply...

226
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,656
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

227
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:33,459
That and the thermite...

228
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,829
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

229
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:38,731
But ranking them as burglars?
-Shit.

230
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:41,768
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

231
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:45,238
They got book learning
but no street skills.

232
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:46,806
Maybe they're college kids.

233
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:48,842
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

234
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:51,277
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:54,080
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...

236
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,383
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

237
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:02,089
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

238
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:05,025
...and not those boys from Juarez.

239
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,415
Your daughter wants out.

240
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:06,149
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

241
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:08,986
<i>We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.</i>

242
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,522
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

243
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:14,224
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier...</i>

244
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:18,061
<i>...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.</i>

245
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,530
<i>I'm realising now...</i>

246
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,733
<i>...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...</i>

247
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,236
<i>...owing to the extra baby weight-</i>

248
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,873
Hey, sweetie.

249
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:38,348
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

250
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,118
No.

251
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,556
No, no. Well, not all of it.

252
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,462
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of-
My stomach, you know.

253
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:54,666
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

254
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,164
How would he know where I live?
-You sure it was Tuco?

255
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:26,464
Who else could it be?

256
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,700
Did you ever tell him my name?
-No.

257
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,869
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

258
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,972
No.
-What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

259
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,341
Did you tell them anything?
-I didn't say jack.

260
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:39,078
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

261
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:43,415
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

262
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:50,890
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

263
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,058
Oh, God. What happens then?

264
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,436
Look, it's got five bullets.

265
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,073
I finally figured out how to...
Look, I just finally-I figured it out.

266
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:09,876
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

267
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:14,014
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

268
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:15,982
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:19,351
I've got a better idea.

270
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:23,457
Thank God.

271
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,058
All right.

272
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:27,594
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

273
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:32,934
Beans.
-Beans?

274
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,470
They're castor beans.

275
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:38,306
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

276
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,042
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

277
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,844
Climb it and escape?

278
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,482
We are going to process them
into ricin.

279
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:50,317
Rice and beans?

280
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:55,491
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

281
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,025
It's toxic in small doses.

282
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:00,661
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

283
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:03,664
All right.

284
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:06,667
All right. So-
-Don't touch them.

285
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:11,038
You can get poisoned from beans?
-Yes.

286
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:15,743
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

287
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:19,580
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

288
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,884
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

289
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:25,487
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

290
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:29,091
But it-It killed him?

291
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,226
Oh, yes.

292
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:35,898
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

293
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:41,068
...and then no more Tuco.

294
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:24,682
Hey, Sky.
-Hey, Hank.

295
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,916
How you doing?

296
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,120
Is this... This a bad time?

297
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,824
No, come on in.

298
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,569
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

299
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,507
What can I do for you?

300
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,613
Maybe we ought-

301
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:57,782
You wanna sit down first?

302
00:31:58,482 --> 00:31:59,550
I don't know, Hank.

303
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,920
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

304
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:10,162
Did she send you?
-Hell, no.

305
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,930
She's barely even talking to me.

306
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,966
That's why I'm here, okay?

307
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,270
Self-preservation. Big time.

308
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,209
Look...

309
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,977
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

310
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,646
I get it.
-Gals.

311
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:32,184
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

312
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:37,389
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

313
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:42,360
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

314
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,431
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

315
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,068
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

316
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,571
Just call her back.

317
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,546
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

318
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:03,817
That's right.

319
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,954
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

320
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,424
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

321
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:14,961
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

322
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:19,631
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

323
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,701
Yeah.

324
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:27,340
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know...

325
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,715
You knew about this.

326
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:39,286
We're working on it.

327
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:42,588
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

328
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:45,692
And I mean, Dave is really good.
-Dave's good, yeah.

329
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,529
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

330
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:52,433
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

331
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,068
I mean, we gotta, you know.

332
00:33:54,302 --> 00:33:57,971
We gotta support the shit out of her.

333
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:00,974
Do we?

334
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:02,544
Yeah.

335
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,712
I need support.

336
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:08,715
Me.

337
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,919
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

338
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:12,920
...with the surprise baby on the way.

339
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,322
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

340
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:18,259
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

341
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:20,462
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

342
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,665
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

343
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,633
And the overdrawn
checking account.

344
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:29,370
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

345
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:32,273
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

346
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:34,642
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

347
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:37,812
But, oh, I see.

348
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:40,648
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

349
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,351
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

350
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:46,288
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

351
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:49,424
...who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

352
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:55,598
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

353
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:14,150
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

354
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,252
That's all it takes?

355
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,988
That's all it takes.

356
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:55,725
So now what?

357
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,029
Now we arrange our next meet.

358
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:01,598
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

359
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:03,834
Business as usual.

360
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:07,738
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

361
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:14,212
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

362
00:36:14,445 --> 00:36:15,580
Care to try it?"

363
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:18,583
Okay, well, what's new about it?

364
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:21,953
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

365
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:23,688
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

366
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:27,390
It gets the user insanely high.

367
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:30,027
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

368
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:33,699
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

369
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:37,068
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

370
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:43,474
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

371
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:46,245
...it'll look like natural causes.

372
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:50,515
What, like a heart attack?
-Yeah.

373
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:52,650
Or the flu, maybe.

374
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,687
His associates won't know
any differently...

375
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,791
...and we'll be in the clear.

376
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,960
Not if Tuco kills us first.

377
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,346
Just keep it down.

378
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:23,682
Hey, Hank. What's up?

379
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,452
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

380
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:29,422
You been home yet?

381
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,293
No. Why?

382
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:34,861
<i>Well...</i>

383
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,431
Because I really screwed up.

384
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,734
<i>I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

385
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:44,704
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.</i>

386
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:50,175
<i>-I should have just kept out of it.
-Yeah, well, okay.</i>

387
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,945
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

388
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:55,850
Yeah, well, that-You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

389
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,618
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

390
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:01,756
Jesus, the wives, huh?

391
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:04,325
Hank, unfortunately, I really-

392
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:08,061
<i>Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

393
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:13,099
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.

394
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:15,034
You wanna see something
really freaky?

395
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:18,507
<i>-Well, I would, but-
-Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>

396
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:23,878
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

397
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:29,216
<i>Hank.</i>

398
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,519
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

399
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:38,058
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

400
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,763
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>

401
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:45,934
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

402
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,505
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

403
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:54,342
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>

404
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:02,184
I'm taking this.
-No. It's my gun. I need it!

405
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,986
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

406
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:08,323
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've...

407
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:11,928
I've gotta get home. My family.

408
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,071
Skyler?

409
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:03,146
Walter, Jr.?

410
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:11,488
Skyler?

411
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:58,369
Hey.

412
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,539
Where's Walter, Jr.?

413
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,411
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

414
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:12,017
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

415
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,290
So where have you been
this time?

416
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:27,667
Walt?

417
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:42,815
Walt?

418
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:03,270
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

419
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,547
Walt!

420
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:18,186
I'll be right there.

421
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:29,496
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

422
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:32,099
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

423
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:33,568
...named Tuco Salamanca.

424
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:36,336
Guess he got tired of associating.
-Yeah.

425
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:39,172
Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
-No, go ahead.

426
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:41,642
Thanks.

427
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,281
The big one smells fresher.

428
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:50,519
You guys find a death wound?

429
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:58,360
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

430
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,296
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

431
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,099
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

432
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,503
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

433
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:22,251
Snap.

434
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:25,287
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

435
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,332
Oh, this is beautiful.

436
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,336
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

437
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,272
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

438
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:44,907
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

439
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:49,078
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

440
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:52,614
...when the stack must have shifted.

441
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:57,253
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

442
00:43:57,454 --> 00:44:02,024
Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
-Don't you just?

443
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:04,361
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

444
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:07,831
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

445
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,907
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

446
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:28,185
I don't know where to begin.

447
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:24,443
What the hell are you doing here?

448
00:45:31,616 --> 00:45:32,684
Get in.

449
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,833
Get in.

450
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:04,750
Let's go.
