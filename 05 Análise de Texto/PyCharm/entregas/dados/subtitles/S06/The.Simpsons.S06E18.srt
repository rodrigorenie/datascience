1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,764
A Star Is Burns

2
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:32,871
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is Eye on Springfield.

3
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,162
Tonight, Springfield's answer
to the Benedictine monks:

4
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,328
The rapping rabbis.

5
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:17,547
Don 't eat pork
Not even with a fork

6
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:19,175
Can 't touch this

7
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:20,927
Marge, are we Jewish?

8
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,212
No, Homer.

9
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:28,811
- But first, we all stink.
- We all... Hey!

10
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:34,190
According to a survey ranking Springfield
as the least popular city in America.

11
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,934
In science, dead last.

12
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,522
I'm telling you people,
the Earth revolves around the sun.

13
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:42,156
Burn him!

14
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:46,985
- What a story.
- You've stolen my soul!

15
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:49,310
In culture, dead last.

16
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:54,242
Eleanor, we've got to do something
about this depression. So I propose...

17
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,337
Oh, that's right. I'm crippled.

18
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:00,632
This is terrible. People
will start to avoid Springfield.

19
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:03,250
But what can I do? I'm just...

20
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,346
...one man.
- I think we should call a town meeting.

21
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:09,220
If we don't do something soon,
we won't get any tourists.

22
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,765
No tourists? I'll be ruined.

23
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:16,434
Maps to movie stars' homes!

24
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,659
Excuse me,
are you Drew Barrymore?

25
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:29,116
What? Get out of here. I'm hung-over.

26
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:31,861
- Sorry, Miss Barrymore.
- What?

27
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,788
Are there any suggestions
for how to attract more tourism?

28
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:42,799
The easiest way to be popular
is to leech off the popularity of others.

29
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:48,342
So we propose changing our name
from Springfield to Seinfeld.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,674
I may be just a boy,
but I have an idea.

31
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,142
If I may, I'd like to show you
a few slides.

32
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:57,147
Springfield as it appears from space.

33
00:02:57,358 --> 00:03:00,857
Somewhere in this windy valley
is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,112
Young man, that appears to be
a picture of your rear end.

35
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,150
So long, suckers.

36
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:12,410
This is the last time I use an escape plan
devised by Milhouse.

37
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:13,993
Sorry, Bart.

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,292
I'm Marge Simpson,
and I have an idea.

39
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,624
Oh, no.

40
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:20,671
Marge is gonna say something.

41
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,633
Now, I know you haven't liked
some of my past suggestions.

42
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,674
Like switching to the metric system.

43
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:29,842
The metric system
is the tool of the devil!

44
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,120
My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead,
and that's the way I likes it!

45
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,306
The old person's remarks
will be stricken.

46
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:39,810
Who said that?

47
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,436
But my new idea is different.

48
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,857
I think we should hold a film festival
and give out prizes.

49
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,947
Could we make movies
and enter them?

50
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,527
- Yes.
- At last, an excuse to wear makeup.

51
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,616
All in favor of Marge Simpson's
film-festival idea?

52
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,405
Film festival! Film festival!

53
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,960
You like my idea?
Actually, I have several others.

54
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:04,457
Don 't push your luck!
Don 't push your luck!

55
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,796
And action.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,589
Hello, I'm Bart Simpson.

57
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:13,298
In the past, I've brought you such
classic films as Homer in the Shower...

58
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,851
...and Homer on the Toilet.

59
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,182
And now I give you The Eternal Struggle.

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,210
Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny.
Stupid Dockers.

61
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:27,895
Oh, the belt is buckled.

62
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,783
Now, Maude, in our movie,
you lay baby Moses in the basket...

63
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,746
...then put it among the reeds, okay?

64
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,534
Lights, camera...

65
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,709
...act-diddily-dotilly-doodilly
action Jackson.

66
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:48,460
Help me!

67
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,555
Flanders to God
Flanders to God

68
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:56,974
Get off your cloud and save my Todd

69
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:07,189
- Thanks, God.
- Okely-dokely.

70
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:08,733
What you doing, Ma?

71
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,278
Looking for a film critic
to judge our festival.

72
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:14,300
Did you know there are
over 600 critics on TV...

73
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:17,536
...and Leonard Maltin is
the best-looking of them all?

74
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:22,410
Welcome to Coming Attractions.
I'm your host, Jay Sherman. Thank you.

75
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:27,373
Tonight we review an aging
Charles Bronson in Death Wish IX.

76
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:30,385
I wish I was dead.

77
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:33,263
But first we have a special guest,
Rainier Wolfcastle...

78
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,380
...star of the reprehensible
McBain movies.

79
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,768
Jay, my new film is a mix
of action und comedy.

80
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:44,521
It's called McBain: Let's Get Silly.

81
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:49,276
Did you ever notice how men
always leave the toilet seat up?

82
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:53,776
- That's the joke.
- You suck, McBain!

83
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:58,320
Now my Woody Allen impression.

84
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:02,198
I'm a neurotic nerd who likes
to sleep with little girls.

85
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,748
Hey, that really sucked!

86
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:11,880
The film is just me in front of
a brick wall for an hour and a half.

87
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,590
It cost $80 million.

88
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:16,637
How do you sleep at night?

89
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:20,639
On top of a pile of money
with many beautiful ladies.

90
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,170
Just asking.

91
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,768
I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive.

92
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,349
He's not obsessed
with his physical appearance.

93
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,152
My ears are burning.

94
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,734
I wasn't talking about you, Dad.

95
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:36,566
No, my ears are really burning.
I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-Tip.

96
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,955
Dear Mr. Sherman, on behalf
of the people of Springfield...

97
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:44,492
...I would like to invite you
to judge our film festival.

98
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:48,286
You can stay with us and enjoy
the sights and sounds of the country.

99
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:51,963
- Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?
- Just a minute, Homer.

100
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:53,462
Look what you made me write.

101
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,672
Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy
our quiet little town.

102
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,303
Sincerely, Marge Simpson.

103
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:02,345
Do I really wanna leave Manhattan?

104
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:07,188
Sherman, I just realized
you insulted me. Now you will die.

105
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:10,147
Hey, nudnik, your shoe's untied.

106
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:14,524
From here, they appear to be tied.
But I will go in for a closer look.

107
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:19,358
Taxi. To the airport!

108
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,760
On closer inspection, these are Loafers.

109
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,919
Attention, the flight
from New York has arrived.

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,669
Hey, I'm landing here.

111
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:41,870
It's supposed to say Jay's name,
not yours.

112
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,971
Oh, you're right.

113
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,681
There you...

114
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:51,854
Just a second. Oh, that should...

115
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,277
Hello, I'm Marge Simpson,
and this is my husband, Homer.

116
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:58,365
Oh, nice to meet you, Marge.
I saw your hair from the plane.

117
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:03,112
And you must be the man who didn't
know if he had a pimple or a boil.

118
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:04,699
It was a gummy bear.

119
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,284
Coming up next, The Flintstones
Meet the Jetsons.

120
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,869
I smell another
cheap cartoon crossover.

121
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,480
Bart Simpson,
meet Jay Sherman the critic.

122
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,506
- Hello.
- Hey, man, I really love your show.

123
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,469
I think all kids should watch it.

124
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,298
I suddenly feel so dirty.

125
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:31,977
I don't know what's happening. It seems
our profits have dropped 37 percent.

126
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,521
We have a bad image, sir.

127
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,399
Research shows people see you
as something of an ogre.

128
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:39,690
I ought to club them
and eat their bones.

129
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,323
Maybe this film festival could help us.

130
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,328
A film biography might let them
get to know the real you.

131
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,994
Virtuous, heroic, nubile.

132
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,324
You left out "pleasant."

133
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,743
But I like that film-biography idea.

134
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,214
A slick Hollywood picture
to gloss over my evil rise to power...

135
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,127
...like Bugsy or Working Girl.

136
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,962
Get me Steven Spielberg.

137
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,128
- He's unavailable.
- Get his nonunion Mexican equivalent.

138
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,808
Listen, Señor Spielbergo...

139
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:09,310
...I want you to do for me
what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler.

140
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,400
Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I
are like peas in a pod.

141
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,606
We're both factory owners.
We both made shells for the Nazis.

142
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:23,910
But mine worked, damn it. Now,
go out there and win me that festival!

143
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,911
Homer, the guest should get
the last pork chop.

144
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,350
But I'm still hungry.

145
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,429
Mr. Sherman, I understand
you have two Pulitzer Prizes.

146
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:49,975
Well, it's not like I carry them
around with me.

147
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:52,352
It's so hot in here.

148
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:57,979
Oh, look, here's my People's Choice
Award. Five Golden Globes...

149
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,447
Where's my Emmy?

150
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,780
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, I won...

151
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:09,370
...the belching contest at work.

152
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,541
Very nice, Homer.

153
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,255
Wow, how many Pulitzer Prize winners
can do that?

154
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:27,388
Just me and Eudora Welty.

155
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,305
I invited my sisters over.

156
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:33,562
Sisters. Allow me.

157
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:44,260
So then I said to Woody Allen, "Well,
Camus can do, but Sartre is 'smartre.'"

158
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,735
So original.

159
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,238
How droll.

160
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:50,910
Yeah, well,
Scooby-Doo can doo-doo...

161
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,497
...but Jimmy Carter is smarter.

162
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:03,593
- Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert.
- So tell us, who's gay?

163
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:05,676
Oh, I don't know. Harvey Fierstein.

164
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:08,551
- No.
- Who else?

165
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,600
MacGyver's gay.

166
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,640
You badmouthed MacGyver,
didn't you?

167
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:26,485
What you doing, Marge?

168
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,735
Making the jury list
for the film festival.

169
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:32,571
Mayor Quimby, Krusty, Jay.

170
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,750
Marge, do you respect my intelligence?

171
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:39,871
- Yes.
- Okay.

172
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,665
Wait a minute. Why did it take you
so long to say yes?

173
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,586
- No reason.
- Okay.

174
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:51,884
Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?

175
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,262
- Yes.
- Okay.

176
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,514
Wait a minute. That's bad!

177
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:01,567
Look, I know I'm not witty
like that critic guy...

178
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:05,235
...but does he know all the words
to the Oscar Mayer song?

179
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:09,534
Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

180
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:13,236
That is what I'd truly like to be

181
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:17,162
'Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

182
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:24,630
Everyone would be in love with me

183
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:31,216
That's it, Marge. He knows
the whole hot-dog song.

184
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:37,179
Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take
a lock of your hair to remember you by.

185
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:39,726
It's just you and me now, lock of hair.

186
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:41,642
You don't have to do this.

187
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,564
- You think I'm stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

188
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:47,316
Prove it. Put me
on that film-jury-festival thing.

189
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,449
Fine. You're on the jury.

190
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:59,120
Sir, the actors are here
to audition for the part of you.

191
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,668
Excellent.

192
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,290
Excellent.

193
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,341
- Next.
- Excellent.

194
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:12,510
- Next.
- Exactly.

195
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,427
Next.

196
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:19,722
Oh, it's hopeless.
I'll have to play myself.

197
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:27,936
I thought they were playing
The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight.

198
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,524
Our first film is by Indian director
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.

199
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,867
Bright Lights, Beef Jerky.

200
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,404
Help! Help! Police!

201
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:39,995
Hey, I got problems of my own
right now. Oh, boy.

202
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,623
This is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

203
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,955
Next, we have Moe the bartender
in Moe Better Booze.

204
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:53,635
Money gets you one more round
Drink it down, you stupid clown

205
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:58,966
Money gets you one more round
You're out on your ass

206
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,396
My back!

207
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,144
Hans Moleman Productions presents...

208
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:10,670
...Man Getting Hit by Football.

209
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:20,955
This contest is over.
Give that man the $ 10,000!

210
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,918
This isn't America 's
Funniest Home Videos.

211
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:30,795
But the ball, his groin.
It works on so many levels.

212
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:32,755
Roll it again.

213
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,797
Next, they're gonna show my movie.

214
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,889
- You made a movie?
- I made a movie?

215
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,143
No wonder I was on the cover
of Entertainment Weekly.

216
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:53,938
My name is Barney Gumble.
I'm 40, I'm single, and I drink.

217
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:04,120
There's a line in Othello about a drinker.

218
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:08,871
Now a sensible man, by and by a fool,
and presently a beast.

219
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,717
That pretty well covers it.

220
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,598
It's brilliant. Savagely honest.
Tender. He has the soul of a poet.

221
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:22,960
You're very kind.

222
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,938
Excuse me. Did something crawl
down your throat and die?

223
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:26,599
It didn't die.

224
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:29,223
My name is Barney,
and I'm an alcoholic.

225
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:31,436
Mr. Gumble, this is
a Girl Scout meeting.

226
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:36,238
Is it? Or is it that you girls
can't admit you have a problem?

227
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:46,499
Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.

228
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,980
I think we have a winner.

229
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,673
- What'd I miss?
- Homer, please pay attention.

230
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:04,678
There's just one more movie.

231
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:18,858
Simple villagers, I promise you...

232
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,279
...I will close plants in America
and bring work here.

233
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,292
We did 20 takes,
and that was the best one.

234
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:38,593
Remember, Elliott, I'll be right here.

235
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:52,729
- Pure egotism.
- Self-indulgent tripe.

236
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:56,359
I don't care what they say.
I'm going to win this festival.

237
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,539
Drink up, Judah Ben-Hur.

238
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:15,500
You truly are the king of kings.

239
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,172
Excellent.

240
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,757
Smithers, are they booing me?

241
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:28,594
No. They're saying,
"Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

242
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,386
Are you saying, "Boo," or, "Boo-urns"?

243
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:36,812
I was saying, "Boo-urns."

244
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:44,279
All right, it's time to vote
for the grand prize.

245
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:50,350
I vote for Barney Gumble's sensitive
yet unfortunately titled film, Pukahantas.

246
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,623
- Second!
- Well, I vote for Burns' movie.

247
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:57,338
Me too. Now let's get going.
I got a date with Eudora Welty.

248
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,131
Coming, Eudora!

249
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:06,173
Excellent. Bribing those
two judges has paid off.

250
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,974
Like the Miss Teen America pageant.

251
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,478
How can you vote for Burns' movie?

252
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,941
Let's just say it moved me
to a bigger house!

253
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,810
I said the quiet part loud
and the loud part quiet. Oh, dear.

254
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,984
Two to two. Well, Homer,
it all comes down to you.

255
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,821
Football in the Groin!
Football in the Groin!

256
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,444
We're not gonna resolve
this deadlock anytime soon.

257
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:31,956
Why don't we all take
a five-minute break. It'll clear our heads.

258
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:36,455
Good idea, Marge.
My mind is going a mile a minute.

259
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:42,589
I knew this would happen.
I put you on the jury...

260
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:46,510
...and you vote for the stupidest film.
- I have a right to be on that jury...

261
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:49,599
...even though I'm sleeping with
the head of the festival.

262
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,603
How many times have
I heard Rex Reed say that?

263
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:54,687
Great. Now you're
gonna make fun of me.

264
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,274
No, Homer. I won't make fun.

265
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:59,111
But I will suggest there may be
better things in life...

266
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:04,616
...than seeing a man get hit
in the groin with a football.

267
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,112
Well, Homer?

268
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:10,234
Marge, I've got some
serious thinking to do.

269
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,625
Barney's movie had heart.

270
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:18,245
But Football in the Groin
had a football in the groin.

271
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:22,122
Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.

272
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:25,530
Wow, I'll never drink another beer.

273
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,928
- Beer here.
- I'll take 10.

274
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:29,970
And now to announce the winners.

275
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:32,600
The award for outstanding
animated short goes to...

276
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,930
...Itchy and Scratchy for their film
Four Funerals and a Wedding.

277
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:08,128
And now the winner of the grand prize.

278
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,260
Barney Gumble!

279
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,100
What?

280
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:22,528
Homie, you voted for the right movie.
I'm glad you were on the jury.

281
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:28,774
You know something, Marge?
It's not that tough being a film cricket.

282
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,567
I've learned I have
a gift to share with the world.

283
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:37,285
From now on, there'll be a new Barnard
Gumble. Hardworking, clean and sober.

284
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,579
Congratulations, Barney.
And enjoy your grand prize...

285
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:44,400
...a lifetime supply of Duff Beer.

286
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,792
Just hook it to my veins!

287
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:53,385
Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play
Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call.

288
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,468
And if you ever want
to visit my show...

289
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,145
We're not gonna be doing that.

290
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:59,222
I hope you tell your New York friends...

291
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:02,518
...that people in small towns aren't
quite as dumb as they think.

292
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:05,650
Marge, look.
This has spring snakes inside...

293
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:08,321
...but the suckers
will think it's beer nuts.

294
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,904
Beer nuts.

295
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,780
Well, it was a lovely festival.
The best movie won...

296
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:18,371
...and Mr. Burns found there are
some awards that can't be bought.

297
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,740
And the Oscar goes to...

298
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:24,711
I've got to win this one.
I bribed everyone in Hollywood.

299
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:28,127
...George C. Scott in
Man Getting Hit by Football.

300
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,306
My groin.

301
