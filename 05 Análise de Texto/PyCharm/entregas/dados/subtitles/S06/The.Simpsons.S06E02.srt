1
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:07,847
Lisa's Rival

2
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:39,836
Lisa, will you keep it down?

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,337
I'm making a crank call
to Principal Skinner.

4
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:45,470
As a matter of fact,
my refrigerator wasn't running.

5
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:48,760
You spared me quite a bit of spoilage.
Thank you, anonymous young man.

6
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,771
It's my room and I can
do what I want.

7
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:54,931
Oh, yeah? Well, I can do
what I want in my room.

8
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,530
Bart, quit it!

9
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,735
I can keep this up all day.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,123
Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying
to fix your mother's camera.

11
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:20,343
Easy. Easy.

12
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:23,551
I'm gonna need a bigger drill.

13
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:36,308
My, these seas are certainly heaving.

14
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:40,317
Well, no more than your
bountiful bosom, my lady.

15
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:44,525
Does that earring
mean you're a pirate?

16
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,202
Kind of.

17
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,446
The seas have quieted.

18
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:54,826
And only in the sweet embrace
of quietude can two lovers truly be as...

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,455
Such noise! Well, I'm done
for the evening.

20
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,670
Lisa, stop blowing my sex. I mean, stop
blowing your sax. Your sax. Stop it.

21
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,641
Mom, I'm auditioning for first chair
in the school band...

22
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,268
...and I've got to practice.

23
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,150
I'm sorry, but I sacrificed
a very expensive camera...

24
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,150
...just to get some quiet time.

25
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:21,190
Fine, I'll play outside.

26
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:25,689
Hey! Why, that sounds
like Gabriel's trumpet.

27
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,410
You know what that means, kids.

28
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,369
Judgment Day!

29
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:34,204
Forty-five seconds till pencils down.

30
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:37,200
Lisa, what's the answer
to number seven?

31
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,840
Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat
the purpose of testing...

32
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:42,463
...as a means of student evaluation.

33
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,461
My cat's name is Mittens.

34
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,596
Three. Two. One.
And that's pencils down.

35
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,847
Now, here's an oral
extra-credit question.

36
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,510
What was Christopher Columbus
actually looking for...

37
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:57,600
...when he discovered America?

38
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,766
Anyone besides Lisa for a change?

39
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,403
Ralph, this better not be
about your cat.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,527
- Oh, all right.
- He was looking for a passage to India.

41
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:11,653
Correct, Allison. And on your
very first day in our class.

42
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:14,197
And during a subsequent voyage,
Columbus found...

43
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,350
...the continent of South America.

44
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:19,875
I never made Miss Hoover "yow-wee."

45
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,100
Hi, Allison. I'm Lisa Simpson.

46
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:26,625
It's great to finally meet someone
who converses...

47
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:28,880
...above the normal 8-year-old level.

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,426
Actually, I'm 7.

49
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,719
I was skipped ahead because
I was bored in the first grade.

50
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:35,430
You're younger than me too?

51
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,271
- Are you hyperventilating?
- No. I just like to smell my lunch.

52
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,819
I never met anyone
who skipped a grade before.

53
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:50,827
I'm surprised you haven't.
You're obviously smart enough.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,492
Well, I'm sure I could have.

55
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:56,748
But I'd hate to leave behind
all my wonderful friends.

56
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,829
Out of the way, brain queen!

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,996
Hey, Sara.

58
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:05,956
Well, I gotta go. I have to practice
for band auditions.

59
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,800
Me too. What instrument do you play?

60
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:09,922
- The sax.
- Me too.

61
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,469
- I'm going for first chair this year.
- Me too.

62
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:16,425
Wow! We have so much in common.
I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.

63
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,177
- Me too.
- Me too.

64
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:23,896
Hurry up and finish eating.

65
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,861
You're steering fine, boy.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,862
Hard to the right. Hard to the left.
Cat! Deer! Old man!

67
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,153
Jackknifed sugar truck!

68
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,657
Sugar?

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,959
Don't worry. Here's a quarter.

70
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,499
Call for help. I'll keep an eye
on things here.

71
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:46,455
If only the sugar were
as sweet as you, sir.

72
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,341
That was downright decent of you.

73
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,337
We hit the jackpot here!

74
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:53,798
White gold! Texas tea!

75
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,552
Sweetener.

76
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,681
Dad, isn't this stealing?

77
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:03,639
Read your town charter, boy.
If foodstuff should touch the ground...

78
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,771
...said foodstuff shall be turned over
to the village idiot.

79
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:09,483
Since I don't see him around,
start shoveling!

80
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,697
- Mom?
- What? What?

81
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:20,614
Why am I rotting away in the second
grade instead of being skipped ahead?

82
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,954
I don't know. I guess that's
the school's decision to make.

83
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:27,421
Did you talk to anyone at school?
Make a few calls on my behalf?

84
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:31,132
You could've been nicer to Principal
Skinner, if you know what I mean.

85
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:34,262
Lisa! I am nice.

86
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,186
Homer, I appreciate you making dinner,
but this food tastes a little strange.

87
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,729
It hurts my teeth.

88
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,346
That's because I've loaded it
with sugar!

89
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:47,810
Marge, our ship has come in.

90
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:50,691
I found 500 pounds of sugar
in the forest...

91
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:53,153
...that I'm gonna sell directly
to the consumer.

92
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,112
And all for a low, low price
of one dollar per pound.

93
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:58,700
But the store sells sugar
for 35 cents a pound.

94
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:01,198
And it doesn't have nails
and broken glass in it.

95
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,831
Those are prizes.

96
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,130
A blasting cap.

97
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,421
It's your turn, Jimbo.

98
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:19,516
Someone's been practicing
over the summer. Welcome aboard.

99
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,636
Yes!

100
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,432
My lute!

101
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:27,856
Lisa Simpson trying
for first-chair saxophone.

102
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:39,662
Very nice. Now Allison Taylor,
also trying for first-chair saxophone.

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,711
This is a very tough decision, girls.
You're both very good.

104
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,140
Well, I guess that clinches it.

105
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,458
That was a close one, Lisa,
but you made it.

106
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,110
I won first chair?

107
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,848
No, you regained consciousness.
Allison got first chair.

108
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,351
Oh, it was just a dream.

109
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,932
That was a close one, Lisa,
but you made it.

110
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,605
I won first chair?

111
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,484
No, you regained consciousness.
Allison got first chair.

112
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,738
And believe me, this is not a dream!

113
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:07,908
I need help. There's another girl
at school...

114
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,837
...who's smarter, younger
and a better sax player than me.

115
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,251
- I feel so average.
- You'll always be number one to me.

116
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:18,795
Hello! First born within earshot.

117
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,468
I meant my number one girl.

118
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,931
Oh, for crying...

119
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:28,678
Honey, if you get too competitive,
you'll never be happy.

120
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,649
No matter how good you are,
there's always someone better.

121
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:36,728
I thought I had the tallest hair, but that
trip to Graceland really opened my eyes.

122
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:39,865
But she's better than me at
everything that makes me special.

123
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,409
Believe me, honey. She's more scared
of you than you are of her.

124
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,117
You're thinking of bears, Mom.

125
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,122
Sugarman!

126
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:54,582
Door to door sugar?
What a marvelous idea.

127
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:57,248
- Who's at the door?
- What's that, Mother?

128
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,999
I'm just talking to the sugarman!

129
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,490
Mother, I'm a big boy.
I can do as I wish.

130
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,133
Excuse me.

131
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,933
Thanks a lot, Simpson,
now I'm grounded.

132
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,102
Hey, Allison, what's the answer
to number nine?

133
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,975
- I can't tell you, Ralph.
- I can't tell you either, Ralph.

134
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:18,110
Leave me alone.

135
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:19,946
- Brainiac!
- Nerd!

136
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,491
You're such a geekazoid!

137
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:23,532
Leave me alone.

138
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,321
That used to be my face in the mud.

139
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:31,416
I can't stand to see you
so miserable, Lis.

140
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,792
Unless it's from a rubber
spider down your dress.

141
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,546
That gives me an idea.

142
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:40,920
Note for later: Put rubber spider
down Lisa's dress.

143
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:51,313
Hey, I know! How about if I dig up
some dirt on Allison?

144
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,267
Remember how I got Milhouse
on America 's Most Wanted?

145
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:58,856
- There he is on the monkey bars.
- Try to take him alive.

146
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:01,656
Oh, no! Not again!

147
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:08,340
I appreciate the offer, but it goes against
every moral fiber in my body.

148
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,874
Suit yourself. If you change your mind,
here's my card.

149
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,248
Don't need it.
You live in the room next to me.

150
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,455
Note: Next year, order fewer cards.

151
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:18,546
And you didn't think
I'd make any money.

152
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,509
I found a dollar while I was
waiting for the bus.

153
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,711
While you were out "earning"
that dollar...

154
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,425
...you lost 40 dollars
by not going to work.

155
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,560
The plant said if you don't come
tomorrow, don't bother coming Monday.

156
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:31,972
Four-day weekend!

157
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,105
Hey, I am above average.

158
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,941
So what if Allison's ahead of me?
There's no shame in being second.

159
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:47,904
And now Avis Rent A Car
is proud to present...

160
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,830
...the second-best band in America.

161
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,409
We welcome Garfunkel, Messina,
Oates and Lisa...

162
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:58,755
...singing their number two hit,
"Born to Runner-Up."

163
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,926
Why would they come
to our concert to boo us?

164
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,173
Lis, I did some checking
on this Allison.

165
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,722
And I know it's against
all your moral fibers...

166
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,554
Give it to me!

167
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,180
Hey, wait. There's nothing bad here.

168
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:18,271
Yep. She's clean as a bean.

169
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,185
But I did tip off the feds...

170
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:24,260
...as to the whereabouts
of our good friend Milhouse.

171
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:27,698
- But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.
- I don't care.

172
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,542
My glasses!

173
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,956
I've got to stop being so petty.

174
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:45,666
I should be Allison's friend,
not her competitor.

175
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:50,802
I mean, she is a wonderful person.

176
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,803
Way to go, Lis. I mean,
why compete with someone...

177
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,184
...who's just gonna kick
your butt anyway.

178
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,182
I prefer my phrasing.

179
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,819
It's great of you to come over.
I really want us to be friends.

180
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:06,640
You're a wonderful person.

181
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,819
Hi, Lisa. I'm Allison's father,
Professor Taylor.

182
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:12,326
- I've heard great things about you.
- Oh, really? I...

183
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:15,741
I'm glad we have someone who can
join us in our anagram games.

184
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:20,800
We take names and rearrange the letters
to form a description of that person.

185
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:23,296
Well, like, oh, I don't know...
Alec Guinness.

186
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,343
- Genuine class.
- Very good.

187
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:29,468
All right, Lisa.

188
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:32,423
Jeremy Irons.

189
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,891
Jeremy's Iron.

190
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:43,393
Well, that's very good for a first try.

191
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,320
You know, I have a ball.

192
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,523
Perhaps you'd like to bounce it.

193
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:59,207
- What's this?
- It's for the school diorama competition.

194
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:02,454
You're finished already?
But the competition isn't for weeks!

195
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:05,459
Lisa, we're talking dioramas.
Who could wait?

196
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,206
I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart"
by Edgar Allan Poe.

197
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:11,511
See, this is the bedroom
where the old man was murdered.

198
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,634
And he's buried here
under the floorboards.

199
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:18,120
And, look, I used an old metronome
to simulate the heartbeat...

200
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:21,437
...that drove the killer insane.

201
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:25,732
Neat, huh?

202
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,278
It's great. It's really great.

203
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,204
Got away from you, huh?
Well, you keep at it.

204
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:52,503
Must protect sugar.

205
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,341
Thieves everywhere.
The strong must protect the sweet.

206
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,806
The sweet.

207
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:04,100
- Homer?
- In America...

208
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:06,766
...first you get the sugar...

209
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:09,150
...then you get the power...

210
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:12,156
...then you get the women.

211
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:13,903
Homer.

212
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,701
- Homer!
- What?

213
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:18,690
Forget about guarding
the stupid sugar.

214
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,156
You're being completely paranoid.

215
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:23,831
Oh, am I? Am I really?

216
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,860
Hello.

217
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:28,461
Where'd you get your
sugar for that tea?

218
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:32,374
I nipped it when you let your
guard down for that split second.

219
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:34,592
And I'd do it again.

220
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,843
- Goodbye.
- You see, Marge? You see?

221
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,638
When are you gonna give up
this crazy sugar scheme?

222
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,590
Never! Never, Marge.

223
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,899
I can't live the button-down life
like you.

224
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,566
I want it all. The terrifying lows,
the dizzying highs...

225
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:51,231
...the creamy middles.

226
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,525
Sure, I might offend a few
of the blue noses...

227
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,720
...with my cocky stride
and musky odors.

228
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:01,456
Oh, I'll never be the darling
of the so-called city fathers...

229
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:04,245
...who cluck their tongues,
stroke their beards...

230
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:08,167
...and talk about, "What's to be done
with this Homer Simpson?"

231
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,132
Look. Just get rid of the sugar, okay?

232
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,717
No!

233
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:22,598
Hey, get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!

234
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,602
Oh, they're defending
themselves somehow.

235
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,439
Look, Bart. It almost killed me...

236
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:35,438
...but I handcrafted all 75 characters
from Oliver Twist.

237
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:38,300
And now the coup de grâce:

238
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:41,653
A bitter snowstorm.

239
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,374
- Is it okay?
- Well...

240
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,460
The important thing
is that we survived.

241
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:58,341
Who am I kidding? There's no way
I'm ever gonna beat Allison!

242
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:00,553
Sure there is.

243
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:06,394
But it involves being a bit underhanded.
A bit devious, a bit...

244
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:09,399
...as the French say, "Bart-esque."

245
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,670
I'll do whatever it takes.

246
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:14,686
Then welcome to the nether regions
of the soul.

247
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,740
Now, here's what we do.

248
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:21,277
Tomorrow, when Allison comes out...

249
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:25,747
...we spray her with the hose,
soaking her from head to toe.

250
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,909
- Leaving us relatively dry.
- Relatively?

251
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,959
There's bound to be some splashback.

252
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,456
Bart, her being wet won't help me
win the competition!

253
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,713
Well, we could just sabotage
her diorama...

254
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,554
...humiliating her in front of
the students and faculty.

255
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,305
- Perfect!
- Leaving her primed...

256
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:43,307
...for the most dramatic
hose-soaking of her life!

257
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,308
Enough with the hose!

258
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,309
Well, sure is quiet in here today.

259
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:53,982
Yes, a little too quiet
if you know what I mean.

260
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,147
- I'm afraid I don't.
- You see...

261
00:16:56,321 --> 00:17:00,106
...bees usually make
a lot of noise. No noise...

262
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,750
...suggests no bees.

263
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,579
I understand now.
Oh, look. There goes one.

264
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:08,321
- To the Beemobile!
- You mean your Chevy?

265
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,911
Yes.

266
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:12,390
Very clever, Simpson.

267
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:13,755
Luring our bees to your sugar...

268
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,248
...and selling them back
at an inflated price.

269
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:20,381
- Bees are on the what, now?
- Simpson, you diabolical...

270
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:23,965
We're willing to pay you $2000
for the swarm.

271
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:25,594
Deal!

272
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:30,134
Oh, wait a minute.
The bees are leaving.

273
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:35,396
No! My sugar is melting!

274
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:38,190
Melting! Oh, what a world!

275
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,203
I'm sorry, Homie.

276
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,407
It's okay, Marge.
I've learned my lesson.

277
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:51,868
A mountain of sugar
is too much for one man.

278
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,918
It's clear now why God portions it out
in those tiny packets...

279
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,423
...and why he lives
on a plantation in Hawaii.

280
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,549
Diorama-Rama. My favorite school event
next to Hearing Test Thursday.

281
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,889
"The Grapes of Wrath"? I don't get it.

282
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,188
Here's the grapes,
and here's the wrath!

283
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:16,523
Yes, yes. Very good wrath.

284
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:20,276
Let's see. Our foreign exchange
student, Uter, has chosen...

285
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,736
...Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

286
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:24,236
I...

287
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,153
But this is just an empty box.

288
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:30,826
I begged you to look at mine first.
I begged you!

289
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,461
Lisa, here is, as the French say,
"Le fake diorama."

290
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,833
I'll create a diversion
and you make the switch.

291
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:43,427
Hey, everybody! Whoa!
Look at me! I'm over here!

292
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,635
Turn this way right now!

293
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:49,383
- Hey, it's Bart!
- And he's doing stuff!

294
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:53,637
- Oh, I can't take my eyes off him.
- Look what he's doing.

295
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:58,180
Bart, stop creating a diversion
and get out of here!

296
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:06,568
Our next entry is "The Tell-Tale Heart"
from Allison Taylor.

297
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:08,866
I can't wait. Be ready with the ribbon.

298
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:15,500
- What is it?
- It's a cow's heart.

299
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:18,623
Them trying to make a monkey
out of you.

300
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,461
Allison, is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

301
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,593
I didn't do that.

302
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,910
I made a different one.

303
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:30,805
Oh, is that so, young lady?
Well, where is this phantom diorama?

304
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:33,722
I don't know.

305
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:42,104
Have the guts to take the blame, girl.

306
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:45,399
- You're compounding your folly by lying.
- Right on!

307
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:48,570
Young lady, cow hearts belong
in a butcher's window...

308
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:52,486
...not the classroom. Well, maybe
in an older student's biology classroom...

309
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:56,247
...but that's none of my business.
Elementary school is where I wound up...

310
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,743
...and it's too late to do
anything about that.

311
00:20:00,214 --> 00:20:03,490
Frankly, I'm starting to regret
skipping you ahead.

312
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:19,596
It's the beating of that hideous heart!

313
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:23,240
I mean, I think I hear something.

314
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:30,363
Why, here's Allison's real diorama.
It got misplaced, or so it would seem.

315
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:34,118
Oh, well, that changes everything.
Let's have a look. Get the ribbon ready.

316
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,122
Little sterile.

317
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:41,252
No real insight.

318
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:43,331
What do you think, Miss Hoover?

319
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,585
This has been
a very disappointing day.

320
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,553
All right, on to Lisa Simpson.

321
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:51,920
You're a shoo-in now, Lis.

322
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,838
After the way I've behaved,
I don't deserve to win.

323
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:56,385
- Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
- What?

324
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:00,312
Now we're into the dregs.
Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.

325
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:04,170
Prepackaged Star Wars characters
still in their display box?

326
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,979
Are those limited edition figures?

327
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,572
What's a diorama?

328
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,525
Why, it's Luke and Obi-Wan.

329
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,452
And my favorite, Chewie.
They're all here!

330
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,279
- What do you think?
- It's lunchtime.

331
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:15,997
We have a winner!

332
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:25,249
I'm really sorry about
what I did, Allison.

333
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:27,749
It's no shame being second to you.

334
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:29,255
Thank you, Lisa.

335
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:31,884
You know, I'm actually
kind of glad I lost.

336
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,306
Now I know that losing
isn't the end of the world.

337
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,634
Hey, you still think we can be friends?

338
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,762
Only if we're the best.

339
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,848
I beat the smart kids,
I beat the smart ki...

340
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,977
I bent my Wookiee.

341
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:49,107
Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me
and Allison to play anagrams?

342
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:53,326
We take names and rearrange the letters
to form a description of that person.

343
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:56,670
My cat's breath smells like cat food.

344
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,480
