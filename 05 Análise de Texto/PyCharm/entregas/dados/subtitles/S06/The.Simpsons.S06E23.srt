1
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,763
Springfield Connection

2
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,120
Aren't you glad we got out of the house
and came downtown for a little culture?

3
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:48,934
They're butchering the classics.

4
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:51,975
Could that bassoon have
come in any more late?

5
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:55,856
Oh, come on, Homer. There's lasers.
You like lasers.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,819
Laser effects, mirrored balls...

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,817
...John Williams must be rolling
around in his grave.

8
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:09,535
Devil-iciously satirical.
I wonder if anyone else got that.

9
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,582
We're out of here!

10
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:18,299
Be careful. These are dangerous streets
for us upper-lower-middle-class types.

11
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:23,509
So avoid eye contact, watch your
pocketbook, and suspect everyone.

12
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:25,887
- Three-card monte.
- Easy money!

13
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,760
Homer, these games are fixed.

14
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,580
Then how come that guy's winning?

15
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,388
I, like, totally won again.

16
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,356
Way to go, bro!

17
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:37,220
He looks and acts just like the dealer.

18
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:39,685
I think they're related,
or at least in cahoots.

19
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:43,720
Just pick the red card.
It's totally not hard.

20
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,284
Twenty on this one, my good man.

21
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,740
Sorry, dude. Black.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,790
Homer, he cheated you!

23
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,331
You're giving three-car monte
a bad name!

24
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,630
Surely you don't blame me?

25
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:04,668
It's people like you who are ruining
our downtown promenades and piazzas.

26
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:07,848
How dare you prey on the greedy
and stupid like this!

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,632
- Bye-bye!
- Somebody stop him!

28
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,646
He's getting away!
Come on! Come on!

29
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,435
No, Marge!

30
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,716
I must warn you...

31
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:55,768
...sometimes ordinary people
get a surge of adrenaline.

32
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,229
- See?
- Cuff him, boys.

33
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,290
We're putting this dirtbag away.

34
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:07,908
I'll be back on the street in 24 hours.

35
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:10,111
We'll try to make it 12.

36
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,743
Marge, are you okay?

37
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,289
I think I'm okay.

38
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:22,246
It was scary, but in a weird way
it was also kind of exhilarating.

39
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:27,170
Yes. It is exhilarating to see police get
their man and save a hysterical woman.

40
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:29,671
Oh, for crying out loud.

41
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:33,134
Easy, now, sweetheart.
Homie's here.

42
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,266
Hey, Mom. Is this how you caught him?

43
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:40,396
Face it, Lis. You're too puny to...

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,357
Lisa, unhand your brother.

45
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,720
Yeah, like that really hurt.

46
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:54,536
Mom, was catching that guy the most
exciting thing you've ever done?

47
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,783
Well, it was pretty exciting.

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,212
But celery soup's pretty exciting too.

49
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:17,182
Strange. Regular ham
doesn't thrill me anymore.

50
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:20,604
I'm crossing over to deviled ham.

51
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:44,666
Marge!

52
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:48,466
Hey, Mrs. Simpson, I just got the new
issue of Sponge and Vacuum.

53
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,877
Thanks, Benevenstanciano.

54
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:57,345
Death sports.

55
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:10,239
All right, get in there.

56
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,774
- You're going down.
- I want a piece of him.

57
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:18,236
You think you're pretty hot, huh?
Well, we got everything we need on you.

58
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,206
- Excuse me.
- What? What? What?

59
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:23,784
What? What? What?
This better be about pizza.

60
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:27,378
Actually, I'm interested
in becoming a police officer.

61
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:43,893
Welcome aboard.

62
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,396
You did what?!

63
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,180
I borrowed your nail clipper.
What's the big deal?

64
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,695
Nothing. I'm just edgy since your mother
told me she wants to be a cop.

65
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,357
Cool! Will you bring me along
when you do evictions?

66
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:59,450
- You got it, little buddy.
- You being a cop makes you the man.

67
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,826
Which makes me the woman.
And I have no interest in that.

68
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,374
Besides occasionally
wearing the underwear...

69
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:08,297
...which, as we discussed,
is strictly a comfort thing.

70
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:10,956
Homer, there's no reason
for you to feel threatened.

71
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:13,928
You'll always be
the man of this house.

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,500
Thanks, honey.

73
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,801
All right, you scrawny beanpoles.

74
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,470
Becoming a cop is not something
that happens overnight.

75
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,685
It takes one solid weekend
of training to get that badge.

76
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,670
Forget about the badge!
When do we get the freaking guns?!

77
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:33,606
Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun
until you tell me your name.

78
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:37,566
I've had it up to here
with your "rules"!

79
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,675
Women always have trouble
with the wall.

80
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:57,338
They never seem to find the door.

81
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,400
You missed the baby.
You missed the blind man.

82
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:36,259
Oh. Sorry, Simpson.
You'll have to do the course again.

83
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:39,513
I was trying to get this
Magic Eye thing to work.

84
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,595
Look at that. A pony.

85
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,400
Hey, everybody! Mom's home.

86
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:56,280
They didn't have my size shirt,
but you get the idea.

87
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:04,242
Wow, Mom. I never pictured you
as any kind of authority figure before.

88
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:07,208
Marge, I want you to take care
of yourself out there.

89
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:09,784
You've become very dear to me.

90
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:11,670
Homie, of course I will.

91
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,706
Mom, if someone shot at the mayor,
would you have to take the bullet?

92
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:18,595
- I suppose I would.
- What about a Coke machine?

93
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:19,883
- No.
- TV?

94
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,262
- No.
- TV with a picture of the mayor on it?

95
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:24,550
Whatever you do,
we'll be proud of you.

96
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:28,137
- Well, thank you, honey.
- As long as it's constitutional.

97
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,729
Homer, give me my pepper spray!

98
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,670
Oh, Marge. One squirt
and you're south of the border.

99
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,821
Incapacitating.

100
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,744
All right, settle, people.
People, settle.

101
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,125
People. Ward and Van Zuylen,
stake out Doughnut Land.

102
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:53,418
When they fry up a fresh batch,
call it in.

103
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:55,249
Keneally and Earhart, back them up.

104
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:57,713
Fitz and Garcia,
it's your turn to sleep in.

105
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:02,550
And, Simpson...

106
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,960
...seeing how this is your first day...

107
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,472
...you're inexperienced
and vulnerable...

108
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:09,990
...your beat is Junkyville
and Bumtown.

109
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,272
Hello, Mr. Hutz.

110
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,362
I'll have you know the contents
of that dumpster are private.

111
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:23,446
You stick your nose in, you'll be violating
attorney-dumpster confidentiality.

112
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,327
I just wanted to say hello.

113
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,810
Hello.

114
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:40,710
You are the new cop on the beat?

115
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:42,677
Okay. I know the drill.

116
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,839
What will it be?
One hundred? Two hundred?

117
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,971
Two hundred. No, no. I mean, nothing.
I don't take bribes!

118
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,804
Yes, of course you don't.

119
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,513
I will just leave this money
on the table...

120
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,561
...with my unseeing back
to the money on the table.

121
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,149
Apu, no.

122
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,158
- That's better.
- That's better.

123
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,360
Don 't you think for one minute
you can go on...

124
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,458
I got a report on a domestic
disturbance at this address.

125
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:15,957
Yes, indeed there is.

126
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,581
There's an inflatable bath pillow
that Mother and I both enjoy.

127
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,501
She claimed it was her day to use it.
I said she was mistaken. We quarreled.

128
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,837
Later, as I prepared to bathe...

129
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,300
...I noticed, to my horror,
that someone...

130
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,303
...had slashed the pillow.

131
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,570
Who called the police?

132
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,689
- We both did.
- We both did.

133
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:38,226
Why don 't you two settle down.
I'm sure you can get another pillow.

134
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,985
Well, I could send it back to Taiwan
for repair. But why should I have to?

135
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,531
I've done nothing wrong!

136
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:47,993
And I don 't give permission for my face
to be on TV. I want it blurred.

137
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:51,578
What are you gonna
do with your day off?

138
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,661
I just want to relax
and forget that I'm part...

139
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:59,212
...of that thin blue line which stands
between civilization and chaos.

140
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:06,718
It's illegal for you to operate that class-9
vehicle without pads and a helmet.

141
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,970
- But, Mom...
- It's for your own safety.

142
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:13,259
Take that, safety boy!

143
00:11:13,437 --> 00:11:18,680
This padding's so easy on the knuckles,
I could punch all day!

144
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,566
I just hope they have
Us magazine in heaven.

145
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,897
He said it was his day
to use the tub pillow!

146
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,566
I can't go to the library anymore.
Everybody stinks.

147
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:37,707
Don't stop talking on account of me.
I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend.

148
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,246
So how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?

149
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:43,961
Law-abiding. I'm done.

150
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:49,175
Moe, I've never seen you here before.

151
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:54,722
Well, these days, my roots don't stay so
chestnut on their own, Officer Simpson.

152
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:58,311
You don't have to call me "officer."
I'm not on duty here.

153
00:11:58,524 --> 00:11:59,852
Finished.

154
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:07,440
Looks nice. It's a good length for you.

155
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,998
Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad.

156
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,411
Shush, dear.
You'll wreck Daddy's fun.

157
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,462
Oh, my Lord!
Something horrible has happened!

158
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,134
Fooled you, Flanders.

159
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:35,178
Made you think your family was dead!

160
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,980
Did you get it?

161
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,608
They're not, though.

162
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,735
- But you thought they were.
- Yeah.

163
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:48,230
That's why it was so funny.

164
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,819
But they're not.

165
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,445
That's a good one.

166
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,863
And that's the drunk tank,
and this is Mommy's desk.

167
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:57,370
Mom, I know your intentions
are good.

168
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:00,991
But aren't police a force that maintains
the status quo for the wealthy elite?

169
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,625
Don't you think we should attack
social problems...

170
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:06,371
...instead of jamming
people into overcrowded prisons?

171
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,963
Look, Lisa!
It's McGriff the Crime Dog.

172
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,129
Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime.

173
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:22,349
Hey, great news, guys!
I picked up a nudie deck for our game.

174
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:24,564
"The girls of the Internet."

175
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:28,234
I'd go online with them any day.

176
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,149
Hey, hey! We've offended Herman.

177
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,905
No, I'm just going out
for some fresh air.

178
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:36,779
That guy sure likes his fresh air.

179
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,995
None of that for me.

180
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,368
Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah, yeah.

181
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:46,623
Homer, you sure it's okay to
smoke Cuban cigars and gamble...

182
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,124
...now that your wife's a cop?
- Are you kidding?

183
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,136
Being a cop husband
is one mighty sweet deal.

184
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:55,341
This police radio entertains me
with other people's miseries...

185
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,888
...we get a free funeral
for Marge, God forbid...

186
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,137
...and I can run background checks
on whomever I want, Momar.

187
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:06,898
Please, please.
Lx-nay on the Omar-may.

188
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:11,944
Hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've
got you clocked at two miles per hour.

189
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:14,322
Put that away.
Radar guns give you cancer.

190
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,492
All the more reason to hurry up.

191
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:18,701
Hey, what could be going
100 miles per...?

192
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,751
Illegal gambling in my house?

193
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,203
Your house? Your house?

194
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,294
Gee, it's so glamorously decorated,
I thought I was in Vegas.

195
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,130
Hey, you guys lied to me!
You said it was Vegas!

196
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:36,221
- We'll be going.
- We'll just be going. See you around.

197
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,950
Marge, you chased away
all my poker buddies.

198
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:40,727
I didn't mean to.

199
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,811
You've become such a cop.

200
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,435
Not that long ago,
you were so much more to me.

201
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:50,441
You were a cleaner of pots, a sewer
of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.

202
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,398
I'm still all those things.

203
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:56,487
Only now I'm cleaning up the city,
sewing together the social fabric...

204
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:59,371
...and unplugging the clogs
of our legal system.

205
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:01,320
You're cooking what for dinner?

206
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,959
Everywhere I look,
someone is breaking the law.

207
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:11,378
Dog, no leash. Man littering.

208
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,459
Horse not wearing diaper.

209
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:17,794
Car parked across
three handicapped spaces.

210
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,135
- Homer!
- Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?

211
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,516
Homer, I'm on duty.

212
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:26,474
That's okay.
I'm supposed to be working too.

213
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:28,143
You have to move your car.

214
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:32,895
I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to
get some beer for those kids over there.

215
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:38,490
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
But you have to move your car now.

216
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,994
I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes
peeled for a real cop.

217
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,204
That's it!
I'm gonna write you a ticket!

218
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,990
- Come on! We're family!
- You're breaking the law!

219
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,451
I'll make you a deal.

220
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:52,164
You rip up that ticket
and I'll give you back your hat!

221
00:15:56,887 --> 00:16:01,216
Homer, taking an officer's cap
is an arrestable offense.

222
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:04,559
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do, huh?

223
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:09,307
"I'm Officer Marge.
I'm gonna arrest you. " Whoa! What?

224
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,402
Marge, not here. Hey.

225
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:15,903
- You're not really arresting me?
- You have the right to remain silent.

226
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:18,720
I choose to waive that right.

227
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,659
All right, Simpson. You're free to go.

228
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:33,412
Let me just finish this last lobster tail
and raspberry torte.

229
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:37,380
All right, Hans. Time to go.

230
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,670
But he ate my last meal.

231
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:43,679
If that's the worst thing that happens
to you today, consider yourself lucky.

232
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:47,220
Are you really allowed to execute
people in a local jail?

233
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,560
From this point on, no talking.

234
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,107
I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer,
but what I did was right.

235
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:01,528
When you need it, you'll be happy there
are dedicated cops like me out there.

236
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:03,535
I have nothing more to say to you.

237
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,996
I'm drawing a line down the center
of the house, à la I Love Lucy.

238
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,369
You stay on your side
and I'll stay on my side.

239
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:16,541
Boy, when Marge first told me
she was going to the police academy...

240
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:20,382
...I thought it'd be fun and exciting.
You know, like that movie Spaceballs.

241
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:24,530
Instead it's been painful and disturbing,
like that movie Police Academy.

242
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:26,846
Hey, Homer.
I'm worried about the beer supply.

243
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,396
After this case, and the other case,
there's only one case left!

244
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,724
Yeah, yeah! Barney's right!

245
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:35,810
Yeah, let's drink some beer.

246
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:38,275
What about some beer?
Yeah, Barney's right.

247
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:42,230
All right, guys. Pipe down.
I got some more in the garage.

248
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:44,906
No. I'll get it for you, Homer.

249
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:48,915
I wonder why he's so eager
to go to the garage.

250
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,538
The garage. Hey, fellas! The garage.

251
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,332
Well, la-di-da, Mr. Frenchman.

252
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:56,669
- Well, what do you call it?
- A car hole.

253
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,592
- You're late, Herman.
- Surely you don't mind waiting...

254
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:07,172
...for merchandise of this quality,
Mr. Jericho?

255
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,188
Looks like good stuff. But, of course,
I'll have to sample it first.

256
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,160
These are fabulous!

257
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:19,653
Yeah. Who would suspect
that they're counterfeit jeans?

258
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,780
What better place to make the buy...

259
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:25,532
...than in a cop's garage,
where no one would suspect a thing?

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,370
Herman, I had to come out here
to see what's so funny.

261
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:38,213
A counterfeit-jeans ring operating
out of my car hole!

262
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,955
I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.

263
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,712
Not so fast.

264
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:44,968
Okay.

265
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:49,530
Maybe you should just stop entirely.

266
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,309
Herman, how could you?

267
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,225
We've all thought
about counterfeiting jeans.

268
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:55,892
But what about the victims?

269
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,487
Hardworking designers like Calvin Klein,
Gloria Vanderbilt or Antoine Bugle Boy?

270
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,740
These are the people who saw
an overcrowded marketplace...

271
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,367
...and said, "Me too!"

272
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,368
Advance on him, men.

273
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,580
I don't think that's a very good idea.

274
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,744
Oh, no! It's Gloria Vanderbilt
out for revenge.

275
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,254
No, it's Officer Simpson of the police.

276
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,928
Herman, your beef is with me!
Leave the girl out of this!

277
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,720
- Okay.
- Homer!

278
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:34,553
It's too late for me, Marge!
Sell the jeans and live like a queen!

279
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:39,107
Is Bart home?

280
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,170
Just taking Maggie for a stroll.

281
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:48,740
I guess I am putting up
the Halloween decorations a little early.

282
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,530
Criticism accepted.

283
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,780
Marge!

284
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,164
- Go, Mom!
- Bust him! All right, Mom!

285
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:00,871
Go back to bed!
Don't make me come up there!

286
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:10,500
Looks like your wife
is embarking up the wrong tree.

287
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:18,183
Freeze! Every mother knows the secret
entrance to her son's tree house.

288
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:21,441
Oh, Marge, you saved my life.

289
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,686
I'm sorry I teased you.

290
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:27,772
You're a really good cop.
I'm proud of you.

291
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:31,492
So long. Gotta catch the 501.

292
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:35,203
- He's getting away! You blew it, Marge.
- I don't think so.

293
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,205
Foiled by my own
shoddy merchandise!

294
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:42,203
That's my ambulance!
I called for it four hours ago!

295
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:44,500
Marge, how did you know?

296
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:45,966
- That the pants would rip?
- No. What...

297
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:49,296
Years of buying pants for children
and a full-seated husband...

298
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:52,900
...has given me a sixth sense
for shoddy stitching...

299
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,974
...which these jeans have in spades.

300
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,512
That's nice work, Simpson, but we
can't hold him. There's no evidence.

301
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,853
There's a garage full
of counterfeit jeans.

302
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:03,358
They've mysteriously disappeared.

303
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,236
Looking good, boys.

304
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:09,989
That's it. There's too much
corruption on this force. I quit.

305
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,499
