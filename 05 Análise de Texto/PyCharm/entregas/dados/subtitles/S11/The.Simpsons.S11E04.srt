00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:10,687
[ Grunting ] I resisted these for 35 years.
Why did I wear them today?.

313
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:16,132
But it's not too late to repent your sins
and be embraced by the Almighty.

314
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,501
Hey, everybody! They're looting the mall!
Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers!

[ All Shouting ]

316
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,703
[ Grunting ]
I'm caught on something.

317
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,304
- I don't want you looting.
- But I was gonna loot you a present.

318
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,748
- Oh, all right.

[ Screaming ]

324
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,566
Well, look at the wonders
of the computer age now.

325
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,977
Wonders, Lisa?.
Or blunders?.

326
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,947
I think that was implied
by what I said.

327
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,986
Implied, Lisa?.
Or implode?.

My pacemaker.
It's stuck on "hummingbird."

"You have been selected
for Operation Exodus."

[ Sobbing ]
Thank you, sweet clown.

I n death, you saved us all.

on Mars with our best and brightest.

346

- That's us!

Uh, Shiny McShine.

Actually, he's Homer Simpson.
That's Bart. I'm Lisa.

352
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,493
Lisa Simpson?. You're the ship's proofreader.
Welcome aboard.

353
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,468
Now, before you enter, you're going to have to
make a very difficult choice.

354
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,404
- You're only allowed to take one parent with you.
- Mom.

- Love ya lots!
- Good-bye, Lisa.

Remember me as I am-
filled with murderous rage!

357
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,347
Well, Son, I guess this is the end.

358
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:54,482
But we've both had long, full lives.

- Oh. Right.
- Hey, look. Another spaceship.

00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,630
And there's nobody
guarding it! Let's go.

361
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,798
I can't believe
I destroyed the Earth.

362
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,033
Are you still talking
about the Earth?.

363
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,042
You're right.
I gotta let it go.

364
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,580
All that counts is we're alive
and rubbing elbows with the greats.

365
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,208
[ Gasps ]
Ooh! There's Ross Perot.

Wait. Only that ship
is going to Mars.

00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,732
- Ours is headed for the sun.
- Yeah. Ain't that a kick in the teeth?.

373
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,274
I mean, my shows weren't great, but I never
tied people up and forced 'em to watch.

374
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,809
And I could've, 'cause I'm a big guy,
and I'm good with knots.

375
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,503
So we're all gonna die?.

376
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,639
Afraid so. But hey, the grub's pretty good, huh?.

The sun?.
That's the hottest place on Earth.

We should do a show together, man.

380
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,053
