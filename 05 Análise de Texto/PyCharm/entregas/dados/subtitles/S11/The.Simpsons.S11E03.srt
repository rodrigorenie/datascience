306
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:37,064
Then why did you put yours
in the window?

307
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,373
Arr, it covered up the ''D''
from the health inspector.

308
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,676
Well, I say we ban Homer
from our restaurants.

309
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,683
No.
That would be impolite.

310
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:48,447
- I say we kill him!
- Now, hold on a minute.

311
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,954
Are we restauranteurs,
or are we murderers?

312
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:53,184
<i>Does that answer your question?</i>

313
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:58,822
We'll kill him at the Taste
of Springfield Festival.

314
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:02,833
We'll give Homer all he can eat,
till he can eat no more.

315
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:06,200
Then he'll get his just dessert.

316
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:11,508
This will be Homer Simpson's
last lagniappe.

Come on!
You're gonna kill him with a pastry?

318

I've seen this man eat a bowl of change.

319
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:19,340
This éclair has over one million calories.

320
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:23,183
Twenty-five pounds of butter
per square inch.

321

- [ All Moaning ]
- Covered with chocolate so dark...

322

- [ Clamoring ]
- No, no, no!

This is just a picture.

325
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:35,463
But Homer Simpson
will find the real thing...

326
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,036
both delicious and deadly.

327
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,628
Ah, yes!
Death by chocolate.

328
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:43,435
[ Laughs ]
Oh.

329
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,407
And poison.
I'll stick in some poison.

[ All Laughing ]

331
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:55,386
Homie, my woman's intuition's acting up.

332
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:58,423
Something bad's going to happen
if you go in there.

333
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:01,857
Oh, Marge, something bad usually
happens to me when I go in anywhere.

<i>A bat.
Now, that's a new one.</i>

00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,901
What are you up to, young lady?

338
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:13,733
I'm reviewing the festival
for our school paper.

339
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,739
Oh.

340
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,436
Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner
is doing so well without me.

Uninspired.

00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,940
I didn't say stop.

345
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,669
Lard ho!

346
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:53,677
Arr, 'tis a good sign.

347
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,646
Homer's unfastened
the top button on his pants.

348
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,980
Uh, no, he's been walking around
like that since Thanksgiving.

349
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,486
I'm surprised he just doesn't give it up
and go for sweat pants.

350
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,786
He says the crotch wears out too fast.

351
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:10,589
Yarrr! That's gonna replace
the whale in my nightmares!

352
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,596
Well, don't worry.

353
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:16,156
The giant éclair will knock Homer
off the food page...

354
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:18,168
and into the obituaries.

[ Both Laughing ]

356
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,007
Wait a minute.
They're gonna kill Dad!

Ooh!

Oh, that's a spicy meat-a-ball!

359
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:44,991
If we don't find Dad,
this crazy French guy is gonna kill him!

360
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:48,999
[ Sighs ] Only your father could take
a part-time job at a small-town paper...

361
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:52,002
and wind up the target
of international assassins.

362
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,504
We can find him faster by splitting up.

363
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:56,939
You take fried foods, you take salty snacks,
I'll take desserts.

364
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,509
Break!
