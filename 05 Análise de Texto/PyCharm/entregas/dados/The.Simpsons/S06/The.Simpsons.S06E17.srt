1
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:08,198
Homer vs. Patty and Selma

2
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,688
This place is gonna smell classy
all week.

3
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:43,359
To Homer, the Wall Street genius!

4
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,450
Hey, Homer, how come you got
money to burn? Or singe, anyway.

5
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:59,744
- Yeah, what's your secret investment?
- Take a guess.

6
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:01,874
Pumpkins?

7
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:05,630
Yeah, that's right, Barney.
This year, I invested in pumpkins.

8
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:08,172
They've been going up
the whole month of October.

9
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:11,843
And I got a feeling they're gonna peak
right around January.

10
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,422
And bang! That's when I'll cash in.

11
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:17,049
To Homer!
And to Sergeant Pepper...

12
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:20,393
...who's growing out of
the middle of your back!

13
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,059
Barn, you gotta unwrap the
plastic before you smoke these.

14
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,556
- Hey, Homer.
- Yeah!

15
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,941
- Hey, Homer.
- Way to go.

16
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:36,067
I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell
your pumpkin futures before Halloween.

17
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:39,370
Let's not panic. I'll make the money back
by selling a liver.

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,915
I can get by with one.

19
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,170
Oh, how am I gonna tell Marge
we're broke?

20
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,294
I need a miracle.

21
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:48,289
My house is on fire!

22
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,256
Insurance to the rescue!

23
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:56,922
- Hello, Homer.
- Hello, Homer.

24
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,847
Marge, we had a deal.

25
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:03,967
Your sisters don't come here after 6,
and I stop eating your lipstick.

26
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:05,937
This is a special occasion.

27
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,307
Patty and Selma just got promoted
at the DMV.

28
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:12,979
Yeah, Homer. Let your wife
have a glimpse of success for once.

29
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:16,151
All right, that's the last straw.

30
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:18,899
Time to take out the trash!

31
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:21,747
But first, I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

32
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:33,418
I'm sorry.
Homer doesn't mean to be rude.

33
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,045
He's just a very complicated man.

34
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,547
Wrong!

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,554
When are you going to wake up
and smell your husband, Marge?

36
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:42,381
You got some kids out of him.

37
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:45,723
But when the seeds have been planted,
you throw away the envelope.

38
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:49,719
I wish you wouldn't put Homer down.
He may not be a big success like you...

39
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:53,267
...but I can always count on him
to provide for the family.

40
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:57,653
Sweet, trusting Marge, I can't let you
down. I'll get some money somehow.

41
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:04,743
Hello, Vegas?
Give me a hundred bucks on red.

42
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:07,742
All right. I'll send you a check.

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,996
If only I could think of an invention.

44
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,042
Something that would
really make money.

45
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:18,457
Must concentrate and work
harder than I've ever worked...

46
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,221
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.

47
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,090
This invention of yours has made us
all rich, especially you.

48
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:32,635
It's simple, yet ingenious.
And it fits right in the palm of your hand.

49
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,476
Every person in America now owns one
of these. In many cases, three or four.

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,226
Can I just get a look at that?

51
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:42,184
Why would you need to see it? You're
the genius who invented the product.

52
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,022
- But could I just...?
- Don't worry.

53
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,614
You'll get to see it just as soon
as we unveil our new ad campaign.

54
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,699
- Let me see! Out of the way!
- Homer!

55
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:55,364
Homer, wake up! There's still
a few minutes till our usual bedtime.

56
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,416
No! My invention!

57
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,791
- My money problems could've...
- Money problems?

58
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:02,535
Homer, are we in some sort
of fiduciary trouble?

59
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:08,209
Oh, Marge, my loyal wife...

60
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:10,088
...of course not.

61
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,218
And Lisa, my little princess.

62
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,060
And who could forget dear Rat Boy?

63
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,228
Rat Boy? I resent that.

64
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:22,648
Bart, I told you before.
Stop gnawing on the drywall.

65
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:26,892
What a day, eh, Milhouse?
The sun is out, birds are singing...

66
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,988
...bees are trying to have sex
with them, as I understand it.

67
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:34,071
It is a gorgeously fabulous day.
Marvelous, even.

68
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:38,118
So, what's your hurry
to get to school?

69
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,705
Nothing. What's your hurry?

70
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:47,162
That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun,
but if we're late, we'll get in trouble.

71
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:50,505
You're right, Milhouse.
Fun is fun.

72
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:58,719
Attention, students. It's time to choose
a gym class for the coming term.

73
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,682
So let's prove how adult we can be...

74
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,307
...by filing to the gym
in a calm, orderly manner.

75
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,643
Even though it's first come, first serve,
and the popular sports fill up fast.

76
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,563
Too many wee ones!

77
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,901
This gets uglier every year.
Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?

78
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:21,742
No, and if they don't get here soon,
it'll be T.S. For them.

79
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,493
I don't feel right.

80
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:30,494
Do you hear that, Bart?
That was the tardy bell!

81
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:34,371
"Truant! Truant! Truant!"
They'll all say!

82
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,966
Who needs him?
I can have fun all by myself.

83
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:42,715
It's all right? It's all right.
It's all right? It's all right.

84
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,265
Sure, Homer, I can loan
you the money you need.

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,396
However, since you
have no collateral...

86
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,315
...I'm gonna have to break your legs
in advance.

87
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,607
Gosh, Moe.
I use these all the time.

88
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,529
- Couldn't you bash my head in?
- Hey, are you a loan shark?

89
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:00,986
Do you understand
how finance works?

90
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,234
Now, let's do this thing.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,953
- Oh, no. It's P.E. Sign-up day.
- How could you forget?

92
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:15,204
They had signs posted
all over the library.

93
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,328
Better sign up for something fast, man.
Baseball just filled up...

94
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,178
So did tae kwon do.

95
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:33,179
There's only one class left...

96
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:36,309
...but it happens to be
the coolest one of all.

97
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,183
Ballet? Dancing is for girls.

98
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,436
Well, you should've gotten here earlier.

99
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,320
I need an extension
on my mortgage payments.

100
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,327
I understand, Mr. Simpson,
but according to our computer...

101
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,202
...your credit history is not good.

102
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:54,781
It says here that you've been
pre-declined for every major credit card.

103
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,628
It also says that you grabbed a dog
by the hind legs...

104
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:00,630
...and pushed him like a vacuum.
- In the third grade!

105
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,588
It all goes on your permanent record.

106
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,294
Sorry, but if you don't have
that money by tomorrow...

107
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,214
...the bank will take your house.
- Good luck finding it.

108
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:11,506
- I'll take the numbers off.
- We'll find a house with no numbers.

109
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,474
I'll take off my neighbor's numbers.

110
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,426
So then we'll look for the house next
to the house with no numbers.

111
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,310
All right, you'll get your money.

112
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,520
You're my last, last chance, bottom
of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot...

113
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,229
...wish you would, but probably won't,
final resort to lend me money.

114
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:31,442
- We'll take care of you.
- Yes. Care.

115
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:56,045
Cut him a check
and get him the hell out of here.

116
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:03,512
What a wonderful dinner.
What a beautiful family.

117
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,681
Get a picture of me with this steak.

118
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,814
You're certainly in a good mood, Dad.

119
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:11,400
Well, Lisa, I managed to solve
a little problem today.

120
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,572
And to celebrate,
I'm going to tilt my chair.

121
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,692
Slanty.

122
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:22,198
Patty, Selma.
What are you doing here?

123
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,495
We thought we'd stop by
unexpectedly for dinner.

124
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,584
Now, bring us extra chairs
like a good "blubber"-in-law.

125
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:30,248
Time to fertilize the lawn.

126
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:33,458
A couple of 500-pound bags
should do it!

127
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,544
Be careful with my sisters' heads.
Their necks are brittle.

128
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,628
That's okay, Marge.
Nothing's broke.

129
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:40,761
Except Homer.

130
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:44,389
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

131
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:50,313
It means these two fabulous babes
are staying for dinner.

132
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:53,318
Now, there's a stink
I could've done without.

133
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:56,101
This has been such a nice,
peaceful dinner.

134
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,691
It calls for a celebration. I'll make the
most international coffee in the house:

135
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:03,951
Montreal Morn.

136
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:07,863
All right, you had your fun,
now get lost.

137
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,616
Our fun hasn't begun yet.

138
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,873
We know something
you don't want Marge to know.

139
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:21,211
Now we own you,
like Siegfried owns Roy.

140
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,588
I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafé.

141
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:29,389
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Oh, Marge, Marge. You're just in time.

142
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:32,230
Homer's getting ready
to give us a foot rub.

143
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,803
- You are?
- No! L...

144
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:39,651
I'm giving them a foot massage.

145
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,899
At least let me have that.

146
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,110
You can start with the corns.

147
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:46,772
Then you can move on
to bunion country.

148
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,818
Okay. Steady, Bart.

149
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,329
Taking ballet doesn't make you
any less of a man.

150
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:02,255
All right, girls. Today we learn
the dance of the fairy queens.

151
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:06,291
You can either be a fairy or a queen.
It's wide open.

152
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,048
And what have we here?

153
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,306
A young man maybe who thinks
he can be the next Baryshnikov.

154
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:17,343
I don't wanna be the next anything.
They made me take this stupid class.

155
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:21,352
So he has fire in the belly.
But it will take more than belly fire...

156
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:25,473
...to be the next Baryshnikov!
- Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies.

157
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:29,109
Ballet is for the strong,
the fierce, the determined.

158
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:31,358
But for the sissies, never.

159
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:35,531
Now, put on this fuchsia-tard.
You are a fairy!

160
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:39,157
- Quitting time.
- On the way home...

161
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,832
...we'll stop at Moe's for a Zima.
- Maybe I'll stay and work overtime.

162
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:46,003
My sisters-in-law
are at my house again.

163
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:47,834
Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity.

164
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:50,499
Pull yourself together
and come get drunk with us.

165
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,967
- Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?
- I don't like wearing tights.

166
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:02,679
But so many of your heroes
wear tights.

167
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:07,393
- Batman, for example. And Magellan.
- Look, I don't like this cootie platoon...

168
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:11,179
...and I never will. I'm out of here,
and I'm out of this stupid outfit.

169
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,011
Wait!
Joy of movement, increasing.

170
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,314
Love of dance, impossible to resist.

171
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:25,359
Toes twinkling. Look at me, girls.

172
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:28,942
I'm doing ballet. And I love it!

173
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,857
Am I wrong,
or did it just get fatter in here?

174
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:38,945
- Request permission to slink by.
- Permission pending.

175
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:41,654
First, light our cigarettes.

176
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,735
But you're already smoking cig...

177
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,870
- You're really pushing it.
- Come on, Homer.

178
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,406
You can't spell "obsequious"
without l-O-U.

179
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,831
- I'll have to trust you on that.
- Marge was always a good speller.

180
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,157
- Let's ask her.
- No! Don't tell Marge!

181
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:01,540
I'll be good. I'll be good.

182
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,869
Just for that, you have to crawl around
on the floor like the dog you are.

183
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,250
But... Yes, ma'am.

184
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:21,588
Now say, "I am Homer Simpson,
the lowly dog. " In a dog voice!

185
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:25,301
- I am Homer Simpson.
- Well, good. Jump, Homer, jump.

186
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:28,388
- What's going on in here?
- Absolutely nothing, Marge.

187
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:30,098
- What's that paper?
- What paper?

188
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:38,182
Homer, is this projection accurate?

189
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:41,222
- Did you borrow money from my sisters?
- I don't know, Marge.

190
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:44,062
I can't keep track
of all my wheelings and dealings.

191
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,273
- He blew your savings on jack-o'-lanterns.
- You told!

192
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:55,393
Sorry, Marge.

193
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,778
I never want to see you again!
You either.

194
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,353
Homer.
Homer, why didn't you tell me?

195
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:07,192
I was ashamed, Marge.
I failed you as a husband and a provider.

196
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,855
And at best, I was a B-plus dog.

197
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:13,284
I'll understand if you wanna sleep
on the couch tonight.

198
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:22,620
- How's Dad today?
- Not too good, Lisa.

199
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,033
- Frankly, he's underneath the table.
- Nobody make me any breakfast.

200
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,578
A man so deeply in debt
doesn't deserve it.

201
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,956
But I like to make you breakfast.

202
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:36,073
In that case, I'll just have French toast
with double butter and a side of bacon.

203
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:39,702
But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it.
Maybe a little powdered sugar.

204
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:49,960
See that?
I started to do, like, a little arabesque.

205
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:53,792
But then I just fully went for it
and pulled off the demi-entrechat.

206
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,758
Not that I'm into that kind of thing.

207
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,340
Bravissimo, Bart!
Next week, class gives its first recital.

208
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,963
And you, you will dance the male lead.

209
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,555
Dance in front of my whole school?
What is it with you and ballet?

210
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:12,092
I know you have great conflict, Bart.
You love ballet.

211
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,801
Yet you feel the boys
will laugh at you, no?

212
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,768
No, I fear the girls
will laugh at me.

213
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,344
I fear the boys will beat
the snot out of me.

214
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,647
- Hey, Dad. What you doing?
- Daddy has very important work to do.

215
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,900
He's looking through the want ads
to find a part-time job.

216
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,356
Dad, that's a gag paper
we got at the carnival.

217
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:35,815
No wonder I didn't hear about Bart being
elected world's greatest sex machine.

218
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:38,692
- I'll never pay off that debt!
- Need money fast?

219
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:41,187
Got no experience?
Step up to elegance.

220
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,732
- Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
- That's it!

221
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:49,235
I'll make money with a chauffeur job!
Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.

222
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,402
I didn't turn it on, I thought you did.

223
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,114
No. Well, anyway, turn it off.

224
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:55,781
It is off.

225
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,204
You have to work hard
to win this crowd over.

226
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:07,956
- Most of them are here for detention.
- Pretty big crowd.

227
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,413
We even bused in troublemakers
from other schools.

228
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,883
That spiky-haired, masked dancer
is really something.

229
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:28,916
- I wonder who he is.
- He's graceful, yet masculine.

230
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,251
So it's okay for me to enjoy this.

231
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,507
This reminds me of the movie Fame,
and to a lesser extent...

232
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,510
...the TV series,
which was also called Fame.

233
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:47,550
Oh, wow, I can't believe my very first
passenger is comedy legend Mel Brooks.

234
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:51,344
I loved that movie Young Frankenstein.
Scared the hell out of me.

235
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:56,770
- Thanks.
- Let's do that 2000-pound-man thing.

236
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,939
I'll be that Carl Reiner guy,
and you be what's-his-face.

237
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:02,645
It's not easy.
It takes the genius of Carl Reiner...

238
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,478
...and the timing that only we...

239
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:07,224
Sir, today, every country
has a national anthem.

240
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:10,686
Did they have national anthems
2000 years ago?

241
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:13,648
Sure! Sure we had.
Of course, we was caves.

242
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,111
But every cave had a national anthem.

243
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:19,115
I'll never forget
my cave's national anthem.

244
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:25,732
- What was that national anthem?
- Let them all go to hell except Cave 76

245
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,365
What's with the si...?
What's with the siren?

246
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:32,951
Evening, Simpson.
Got a short in your taillight.

247
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:35,030
Started blinking
when you made that turn.

248
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,989
- Let's see your chauffeur's license.
- Chauffeur's license, eh?

249
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,667
Mel, buckle your borscht belt!

250
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,291
Since you're trying to make
a getaway in park...

251
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:48,667
...I'm guessing you don't
have a license.

252
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:51,672
Better head to the DMV.
These two broads'll help you out.

253
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,622
Wow. Officer, this man
is making me a little edgy.

254
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:02,176
- Could you give me a ride to the airport?
- Hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks!

255
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,418
- Sure, I'll give you a ride.
- Thank you.

256
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:08,674
On the way we can do that
2000-dollar-man thing.

257
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,514
You be Carl Reiner,
and I'll be Police Chief Wiggum.

258
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:15,463
Listen, why don't you play Carl Reiner,
and let me play Police Chief Wiggum.

259
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:17,264
I hate Carl Reiner!

260
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:23,894
I haven't been moved like this
since The Joy Luck Club.

261
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:31,806
They love me. I'm accepted.
I don 't need this mask anymore.

262
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,473
Behold! The masked dancer is me, Bart!

263
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:41,314
- It is I who have won your acclaim!
- Bart does ballet!

264
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,524
He dances like girls!

265
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,564
Go ahead and laugh. I took a chance
and did what I wanted to do.

266
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,608
And if that makes me a sissy,
well, then, I guess I'm a sissy.

267
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:56,452
He's a sissy! Let's rush him!

268
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,449
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's get him, come on!

269
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,034
After him! Go!

270
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:08,288
- There he is! There, right there!
- Bart, use the ballet. Leap!

271
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:12,498
Leap like you've never leapt before!

272
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:22,918
Looks like he took a pretty bad spill.

273
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,206
Well, as long as he's hurt.

274
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,748
Bart, I am so proud of you. You've
shown a sensitive side of yourself...

275
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:36,252
...that can never be erased. From this
day forward, we are kindred spirits.

276
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:42,262
Why'd she just leave me here
when I clearly need medical attention?

277
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:47,595
Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV...

278
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,007
...where stupid Patty
and stupid Selma work.

279
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:54,220
Sometimes I think God is teasing me,
just like he teased Moses in the desert.

280
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:58,888
Tested, Homer. God tested Moses.
And try to be nice to my sisters.

281
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,387
It's very hard on me
to have you always fighting.

282
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,852
Oh, okay, Marge.
I'll get along with them.

283
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:05,599
Then I will hug some snakes.

284
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:10,433
Yes! I will hug and kiss
some poisonous snakes!

285
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,888
Now, that's sarcasm.

286
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,726
Well, well, well.
Look who needs us again...

287
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:18,059
...to get his chauffeur's license.

288
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,230
Look, all I ask is that you be fair.

289
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:23,020
Did not adjust side mirror.
Minus one point.

290
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,319
Failed to check blind spot.
Minus two points.

291
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,861
You'll be happy when my
family thinks I'm a loser.

292
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,447
You are a loser, Homer!
And we're winners. You gotta learn that.

293
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,823
Seat belt twisted. Minus one point.

294
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:36,366
Nagging the driver.
Minus 10 points for you!

295
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:39,536
- Grazed a cone. Minus five.
- Being a jerk. Minus a million!

296
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:45,664
One more wrong answer, and Homer
flunks another of life's little tests.

297
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,038
And what's this?

298
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,705
Someone didn't fill in a circle
all the way.

299
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,670
- Oh, boy. Oh, that felt good.
- Let me try. Let me try.

300
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,329
Yeah. Oh, boy.
Oh, that was so sweet.

301
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,707
- So, Homer, how'd you do?
- Well, I...

302
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:12,958
Ladies, please don't tell me
you're smoking in a government building.

303
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:15,258
Because that is
the kind of infraction...

304
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,048
...that can cost a couple of sisters
their promotion.

305
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,085
- Well...
- What?

306
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:22,220
- You mean...
- Why...

307
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,675
Oh, you're talking about she...
Who's? What? She... What, this?

308
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:34,561
I'll never forgive myself for this.

309
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:39,726
Wait a minute. Those are yours, sir?

310
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:43,515
Yes. I am in flavor country.

311
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:47,273
- Both of them?
- It's a big country.

312
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:50,899
Ladies, I apologize.
And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.

313
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:56,108
Homer, I'm... I'm speechless.

314
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,948
- You just saved our hides.
- On top of everything else...

315
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:02,565
...don't make me picture your hides.
- It's a wonderful thing you did...

316
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:04,947
...for my sisters.
- I didn't do it for them.

317
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,533
I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you.

318
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:11,738
- Please ask me to kill for you.
- No, Homie.

319
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:15,956
You see? This is the stuff I've been
telling you about that you never see.

320
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,202
Homer.

321
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,868
We're... sorry.

322
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:24,532
- Lf there's anything we can do...
- Call off the debt?

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,377

324
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,253
Call off the debt?

325
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,543
- Well...
- Debt's off! Let's go, Marge!
